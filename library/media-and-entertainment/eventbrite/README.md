# Eventbrite CLI

**Every Eventbrite organizer endpoint, plus a local SQLite mirror of your events, orders, and attendees you can search offline — the cross-event search Eventbrite removed, restored over your own data.**

Existing Eventbrite tools wrap a handful of event CRUD calls one event at a time. This CLI mirrors the full v3 organizer API and syncs your events, orders, attendees, ticket classes, and discounts into a local SQLite store, then layers cross-event analytics on top: sales-velocity ranks your live events by sell rate, repeat-attendees surfaces returning fans across your whole history, and org-rollup gives agencies a single pane across every client organization.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `eventbrite-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-eventbrite` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install eventbrite
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install eventbrite --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install eventbrite --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install eventbrite --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install eventbrite --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/eventbrite/cmd/eventbrite-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/eventbrite-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install eventbrite --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-eventbrite --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-eventbrite --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install eventbrite --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/eventbrite-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `EVENTBRITE_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/eventbrite/cmd/eventbrite-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eventbrite": {
      "command": "eventbrite-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "EVENTBRITE_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Eventbrite uses an OAuth2 private token sent as a Bearer header. For your own account you do not need the full OAuth dance — copy a private token from eventbrite.com/platform/api-keys and set EVENTBRITE_API_KEY. Run `eventbrite-pp-cli doctor` to confirm it is picked up.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Confirm EVENTBRITE_API_KEY is set and the API is reachable before anything else.
eventbrite-pp-cli doctor

# Pull everything your token can access into local SQLite; Eventbrite paginates with continuation tokens, which sync follows automatically.
eventbrite-pp-cli sync

# Rank your live events by tickets sold per day so you can see laggards at a glance.
eventbrite-pp-cli sales-velocity --json

# Find fans who attended multiple events — the cross-event view Eventbrite's public search no longer provides.
eventbrite-pp-cli repeat-attendees --min 2 --json

# Full-text search across everything you have synced offline.
eventbrite-pp-cli search "VIP"

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-event sales analytics
- **`sales-velocity`** — Ranks all your live events by tickets sold per day since on-sale and projects a sell-out date.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs to know which of an organizer's events are underperforming right now, not just current totals._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli sales-velocity --json
  ```
- **`discount-performance`** — Per discount code: redemptions, type, and the redemption rate (share of the code's allotment used).

  _Pick this to measure whether a promo code actually drove sales before renewing or killing it._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli discount-performance --json
  ```
- **`capacity`** — Sold vs total capacity and percent remaining across all your live events at once.

  _Use this to spot which events are near sell-out or badly under-sold in a single call._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli capacity --json
  ```
- **`refund-rate`** — Refunded and cancelled order counts, refunded revenue, and the rate per event or across the org.

  _Pick this to flag events with abnormal refund rates that signal a pricing, date, or fulfillment problem._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli refund-rate --json
  ```
- **`top-buyers`** — Ranks ticket buyers by total spend across all your events, not just by how many events they attended.

  _Reach for this to find an organizer's highest-value customers for VIP or pre-sale outreach._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli top-buyers --limit 25 --json
  ```

### Search your own data offline
- **`repeat-attendees`** — Finds fans who bought into two or more of your events, across your whole synced history.

  _Use this for loyalty and re-marketing questions an agent cannot answer from any one event's attendee list._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli repeat-attendees --min 2 --json
  ```
- **`roster`** — Offline attendee roster for one event with checked-in vs not-yet, VIP and comp flags, door-sorted.

  _Reach for this at the door when an agent needs a fast who-has-not-checked-in list without a live API round-trip._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli roster 1234567890 --csv
  ```
- **`fan-export`** — Exports unique attendee contacts (email, name, events attended, check-in status), deduped across all your events and filterable by event.

  _Use this to build a clean, deduped contact list for an email campaign across an organizer's whole audience._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli fan-export --csv
  ```

### Agency multi-org view
- **`org-rollup`** — Single pane across every organization your token can see: events count, tickets sold, gross, and top event per org.

  _Use this for an agency or multi-brand operator who needs one client roll-up instead of logging into each org._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli org-rollup --json
  ```

## Recipes

### Find your slowest-selling live events

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli sales-velocity --json
```

Ranks every live event by tickets sold per day since on-sale with a projected sell-out date, computed from the local order store.

### Surface returning fans for re-marketing

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli repeat-attendees --min 3 --agent --select email,name,events_count
```

Cross-event attendee join; --agent emits structured rows and --select narrows to just the contact fields an email tool needs.

### Door check-in roster, offline

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli roster 1234567890 --csv
```

Prints the synced attendee roster for one event with checked-in status as CSV for a will-call sheet — no live API call required.

### Agency Friday client roll-up

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli org-rollup --json
```

One pane across every organization the token can see: events, tickets sold, gross, and top event per client org.

### Measure a promo code's ROI

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli discount-performance --json
```

Ranks discount codes by redemptions and redemption rate (share of each code's allotment used) from the synced discount objects.

### Combine Eventbrite + DICE for full event performance

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli fan-export --json
```

Export your Eventbrite buyer/attendee list as JSON; a promoter selling the same show on DICE exports the DICE side too, then an agent joins events by name and date and buyers by normalized email for a cross-platform performance and loyalty view no single platform shows.

## Usage

Run `eventbrite-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Commands

### balance

Manage balance

### categories

<a name="categories_object"></a>

## Category Object

An overarching category that an event falls into (vertical). Examples are “Music”, and “Endurance”.

- **`eventbrite-pp-cli categories category-by-id`** - Gets a `category` by ID as ``category``.
- **`eventbrite-pp-cli categories list-of`** - Returns a list of Category as categories, including subcategories nested. Returns a paginated response.

### discounts

<a name="discount_object"></a>

## Discount Object

The Discount object represents a discount that an Order owner can use when purchasing tickets to an [Event](#event_object).

A Discount can be used to a single [Ticket Class](#ticket_class_object) or across multiple Ticket Classes for multiple Events simultaneously (known as a cross event Discount).

There are four types of Discounts:

+ **Public Discount.** Publically displays Discount to Order owner on the Event Listing and Checkout pages. Only used with a single Event.

+ **Coded Discount.** Requires Order owner to use a secret code to access the Discount.

+ **Access Code.** Requires Order owner to use a secret code to access hidden tickets. Access codes can also optionally contain a discount amount.

+ **Hold Discount.** Allows Order owner to apply or unlock Discount for seats on hold.

The display price of a ticket is calculated as: \
`price_before_discount` - `discount_amount` = `display_price`

Notes:

* Public and Coded Discounts can specify either an amount off or a percentage off, but not both types discounts.

* Public Discounts should not contain apostrophes or non-alphanumeric characters (except “-���, “_”, ” ”, “(”, ”)”, “/”, and “”).

* Coded Discounts and Access Codes should not contain spaces, apostrophes or non-alphanumeric characters (except “-”, “_”, “(”, ”)”, “/”, and “”).

The following conditions define the extend of the Discount:

* If `event_id` is provided and `ticket_class_ids` are not provided, a single Event Discount is created for all Event tickets.

* If both `event_id` and `ticket_class_ids` are provided, a single Event Discount is created for the specific Event  tickets.

* If `ticket_group_id` is provided, a Discount is created for the Ticket Group.

* If neither `event_id` nor `ticket_group_id` are provided, a Discount is created that applies to all tickets for an [Organization's](#organization_object) Events, including future Events.

The Organization object is used to group Members, [Roles](#roles_object), [Venues](#venue_object) and [Assortments](#assortments_object).

#### Public Fields

Use these fields to specify information about an Organization.

|   Field    |   Type   |                                                                       Description                                                                        |

### pricing

<a name="Pricing_object"></a>

## Pricing Object

The Pricing object represents all the available fee rates for different currencies, countries, [Assortments](#assortments_object) and sales channels.

- **`eventbrite-pp-cli pricing calculate-items`** - Calculates the Fees that Eventbrite would charge for a given price as it’s shown on the ticket authoring flow. This price would be hypothetical, as the pricing calculation would be based on the passed parameters instead of facts as it happens when an order is created.

This price is a simplified view. The price reported can’t be used to calculate the price of an order. Its used to get fees, taxes and total price depending from scope parameter. The scope can be as one of the members: `organization`, `event`, `ticket_class` or `assortment_plan`.

Depending on the scope type, the scope identifier has different meanings:
For scope.type ``organization`` scope.identifier represents an organization id.
For scope.type ``event`` scope.identifier represents an event id.
For scope.type ``ticket_class`` scope.identifier represents a ticket class id.
For scope.type ``assortment_plan`` scope.identifier can take a value of either 'package1' or 'package2'

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
eventbrite-pp-cli formats list

# JSON for scripting and agents
eventbrite-pp-cli formats list --json

# Filter to specific fields
eventbrite-pp-cli formats list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
eventbrite-pp-cli formats list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
eventbrite-pp-cli formats list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/eventbrite-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EVENTBRITE_API_KEY` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `eventbrite-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $EVENTBRITE_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific
- **401 Unauthorized on every call** — Set EVENTBRITE_API_KEY to a private token from eventbrite.com/platform/api-keys, then run `eventbrite-pp-cli doctor`.
- **Public event search returns nothing or 404** — Eventbrite removed public event search in 2020; sync your org first with `sync` and search the local store with `search` or `repeat-attendees`.
- **sync stops before all records load** — List endpoints page with continuation tokens; re-run `eventbrite-pp-cli sync --full` to walk every page.
- **sales-velocity or capacity returns empty** — These read the local store — run `eventbrite-pp-cli sync` first.
