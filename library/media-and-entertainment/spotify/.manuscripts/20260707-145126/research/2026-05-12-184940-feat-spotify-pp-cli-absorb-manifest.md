# Spotify CLI — Absorb Manifest

## Sources scanned

Step 1.5a swept the leading wrappers, terminal clients, and MCP servers for the Spotify Web API to establish the absorbed-feature floor. Sources surveyed:

- **spotipy** (Python SDK, ~7000 stars, ~300 methods) — gold-standard endpoint coverage; the de-facto reference for what a "complete" Spotify client looks like in code.
- **spotify-tui / `spt`** (Rust TUI + CLI, ~17000 stars) — closest direct competitor in CLI shape. Ships `spt playback`, `spt list`, `spt query` subtrees.
- **ncspot** (Rust ncurses client) — playback-controller patterns; not a one-shot CLI but the keybindings map cleanly onto commands.
- **shpotify** (bash + AppleScript) — controls the *desktop app*, not the Web API. Different mental model; informs the "kill local-app dependence" framing.
- **spotify-cli-linux** (Python, dbus + MPRIS) — distro-bound; useful only as a naming-convention reference.
- **spotify-web-api-node** (JavaScript SDK, ~2700 stars) — endpoint-coverage parity check.
- **rspotify** (Rust SDK) — Rust client used by spotify-tui; another endpoint completeness benchmark.
- **marcelmarais/spotify-mcp-server** (TypeScript, lean ~10-tool MCP server) — the MCP tool-shape floor.
- **PeterAkande/spotify_mcp** (Python FastMCP, 36 tools) — broader MCP coverage with named tools mapped to spotipy methods.
- **varunneal/spotify-mcp** and **tylerpina/spotify-mcp** — corroborating MCP tool-naming conventions.
- **Spotify Web API** itself — authoritative endpoint list via the community-fixed OpenAPI mirror (`sonallux/spotify-web-api`).

## Stubs (shipping but honest)

Each stub below is a real command in the Cobra tree so the surface is discoverable, but it exits `0` with a structured deprecation payload instead of attempting a request that we know returns `403`/`404` for apps created after 2024-11-27. Each stub respects a future `--legacy-app` opt-in flag that lets users with grandfathered extended-quota apps attempt the real call.

Common stub payload shape (with `--json`):
```json
{
  "status": "stub_deprecated",
  "reason": "Spotify removed access to this endpoint for apps created after 2024-11-27. The user's app is a new app and will receive 403/404 on this endpoint.",
  "next_action": "If you have a legacy extended-quota app, retry with --legacy-app to attempt the real request.",
  "spotify_blog_url": "https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api"
}
```

Stubs:

- `audio-features <id>` — stub. Reason: 2024-11-27 deprecation. `--legacy-app` opt-in attempts the real `GET /audio-features/{id}` call.
- `audio-features several <ids...>` — stub. Same as above for `GET /audio-features?ids=`.
- `audio-analysis <id>` — stub. Reason: 2024-11-27 deprecation. `--legacy-app` opt-in attempts the real `GET /audio-analysis/{id}` call.
- `recommendations [--seed-tracks <ids>] [--seed-artists <ids>] [--seed-genres <list>] [--target-*]` — stub. Reason: 2024-11-27 deprecation. The seed/target flag surface is preserved so users on legacy apps (with `--legacy-app`) get the full functionality.
- `artists related <id>` — stub. Reason: 2024-11-27 deprecation removed `GET /artists/{id}/related-artists`. `--legacy-app` opt-in attempts the real call.
- `playlists featured [--country <code>] [--locale <code>] [--timestamp <iso>] [--limit N]` — stub. Reason: 2024-11-27 deprecation removed `GET /browse/featured-playlists`. `--legacy-app` opt-in attempts the real call.
- `browse categories playlists <category-id> [--country <code>] [--limit N]` — stub. Reason: 2024-11-27 deprecation removed `GET /browse/categories/{id}/playlists`. The parent `browse categories` list still works and is shipped non-stub (row 56). `--legacy-app` opt-in attempts the real call.

Each stub is annotated `cmd.Annotations["mcp:read-only"] = "true"` so an MCP host knows the stub itself is safe; the `--legacy-app` real call inherits the read-only nature of the underlying endpoint (all of these are `GET`s).

## Transcendence (novel — only possible with our approach)

| # | Feature | Command | Score | Persona | Why only we can do this |
|---|---------|---------|-------|---------|--------------------------|
| T1 | Snapshot-aware playlist diff | `playlists diff <id> [--against-snapshot <sid>]` | 9/10 | Naomi (music journalist) | Reads current playlist + tracks, compares to `playlist_tracks` rows keyed by prior `snapshot_id`, emits add/remove/reorder set. Spotify's snapshot_id is a defining surface no UI exposes — competitors don't store snapshots, so they can't diff. |
| T2 | ISRC-aware playlist dedupe | `playlists dedupe <id> [--by isrc\|track-id\|title-artist] [--apply]` | 9/10 | Marcus (bedroom DJ) | Joins local `playlist_tracks` to `tracks.isrc`, groups, reports duplicates; `--apply` calls Spotify's remove-tracks with snapshot guard. Catches the album/single/EP/deluxe-reissue dupe class that ID-based dedupe misses. |
| T3 | Cross-playlist merge with dedupe | `playlists merge <src-1> <src-2> [...] --into <dest> [--dedupe-by isrc] [--order keep\|shuffle\|by-date]` | 8/10 | Marcus | Reads source rows from local `playlist_tracks`, dedupes locally, POSTs to `<dest>` in 100-track chunks. Spotify ships no merge primitive; users currently script this against `spotipy`. |
| T4 | Top-tracks rotation drift | `top drift --range short\|medium\|long --since <date>` | 9/10 | Naomi | Two-row diff over `top_tracks_snapshot` filtered by `time_range` + `captured_at`; emits risen/fallen/stable cohorts. Spotify's top-tracks endpoint returns "current" only — without local snapshotting there is no drift answer. The product thesis's headline transcendence move. |
| T5 | Release-Radar replacement | `releases since <date> [--from followed]` | 8/10 | Naomi | Iterates `followed_artists`, calls `GET /artists/{id}/albums?include_groups=album,single&min_release_date=<date>` per artist, sorts by release date desc. Replaces Spotify's algorithmic Release Radar (deprecated for new apps on 2024-11-27) with a deterministic feed the user actually controls. |
| T6 | Cross-entity track lookup | `tracks where <id-or-uri>` | 7/10 | Naomi + Marcus | Single track_id joins against `playlist_tracks`, `saved_tracks`, `play_history`, `top_tracks_snapshot` — pure local SQL. Spotify's app has no "where is this track in my library" view; users currently dupe-add tracks because they can't tell. |
| T7 | Play-history by listening context | `play history --by context [--since <window>]` | 7/10 | Marcus + Naomi | Aggregates `play_history.context_uri`, joins to playlists/albums/artists for display names, ranks by play count and duration within window. Answers "which of my set lists is actually getting played" — Spotify's API exposes context but no UI surface aggregates it. |
| T8 | Agent-friendly queue-from-saved | `queue from-saved [--limit N] [--artist <id>] [--playlist <id>]` | 7/10 | Priya (agent-loop operator) | Selects N rows from local `saved_tracks` (optional filters), POSTs each URI to `/me/player/queue`; surfaces `403 PREMIUM_REQUIRED` cleanly. Lets agents queue "from my chillout saved tracks" by intent instead of by URI. |
| T9 | Genre-walked artist discovery | `discover artists [--seed top\|saved\|followed] [--limit N] [--exclude-followed]` | 9/10 | All personas (user-requested) | Walks the `genres` field on my top/saved/followed artists, calls `/search?type=artist&q=genre:"<g>"` for each unique genre, ranks unfollowed artists by popularity × genre-match-score. Replaces Spotify's deprecated `/recommendations` for the "artists I might like" question — uses search + genre tags, which still work for new apps. |
| T10 | Co-occurrence discovery via public playlists | `discover via-playlists <seed-artist-id> [--depth 1] [--min-cooccurrence 3] [--limit N]` | 8/10 | Naomi + Marcus (user-requested) | Searches public playlists containing the seed artist (`/search?type=playlist&q=<artist-name>`), fetches each playlist's tracks, counts co-occurring artists across the corpus, ranks by frequency. Spotify's `/related-artists` is deprecated for new apps; public playlists become the graph substrate. |
| T11 | Artist deep-dive (gap finder) | `discover artist-gaps <artist-id> [--show all\|saved\|unsaved] [--include-groups album,single,compilation]` | 7/10 | Naomi (user-requested) | Lists artist's full discography chronologically from `/artists/{id}/albums`, joins to local `saved_albums` + `playlist_tracks` to mark each as saved or unsaved. Answers "I love this artist — what have I missed?" Spotify's app shows discography but not your coverage of it. |
| T12 | New releases in your genres (Release Radar replacement, wider) | `discover new-releases [--seed-from top\|followed] [--days 30] [--exclude-followed] [--limit N]` | 8/10 | Naomi + all (user-requested) | Pulls global `/browse/new-releases`, fetches each release artist's genres, keeps only releases whose artists share a genre with my top/followed artists, optionally excludes artists I already follow (T5's surface). Surfaces adjacent discovery — "new releases from artists like the ones I follow, but not them." |
| T13 | Play to device by friendly name | `play-on <device-name> [--uris <json>] [--context-uri <uri>]` | 8/10 | Priya (agent-loop) + all | Resolves a friendly name (e.g. "living room") against both the live `/me/player/devices` list and the locally cached `devices_seen` table, then starts playback. Spotify's API only takes opaque device IDs, so every other client requires list-then-copy/paste. Cached entries let agents reference devices that aren't currently online with a typed "wake the device first" hint instead of a raw 404. Side-effect: every call refreshes `devices_seen` from the live list. |

## Live dogfood findings (2026-05-12 new app)

Live testing against a brand-new Spotify dashboard app (registered today) revealed the 2024-11-27 deprecation hits more endpoints than Spotify's blog post lists. Anyone reading this manifest with a "legacy" app (registered before 2024-11-27) may see fuller functionality. The product is shipping with these caveats documented:

- **`artist.genres` and `artist.popularity` are null on all artist responses for new apps.** Not on Spotify's announced deprecation list. Structurally blocks any feature that walks an artist's genre tags from a fresh API call. **T9 (`discover artists`)** returns `"no genres in seed source"` on new apps; works for legacy apps. **T12 (`discover new-releases`)** can't filter by genre overlap; the underlying `/browse/new-releases` also returns 403 (also undocumented in the blog post).
- **`/playlists/{id}/tracks` returns `{track: null}` items for Spotify-owned editorial/algorithmic playlists on new apps.** Means **T10 (`discover via-playlists`)** typically returns empty results when `/search?type=playlist` happens to return only Spotify-curated playlists. Still works when user-created playlists rank in the search results.
- **`/artists/{id}/albums` rejects `limit` > ~10 with HTTP 400 "Invalid limit" on new apps,** despite the OpenAPI spec and docs declaring max=50. **T11 (`discover artist-gaps`)** uses `limit=10` with cursor pagination via the response's `next` URL — works fine, just costs more round trips.
- **`/me/*` endpoints behave per spec** (top tracks, top artists, recently-played, saved, followed all paginate at limit=50 as documented). The post-2024-11-27 restrictions appear scoped to third-party content endpoints.

T9, T10, and T12 are shipped as runnable commands rather than stubs because they work in mock-mode + verify, dogfood gracefully (T9 returns a typed `no genres in seed source` hint, T12 surfaces a 403 with explanatory hint), and become functional automatically on legacy apps or once Spotify re-opens the endpoints.
