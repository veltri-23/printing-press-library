# Movie Goat CLI

**The movie CLI that combines TMDb's discovery engine with OMDb's multi-source ratings — and ships a SQLite watchlist that flags what's streaming on your services right now.**

Movie Goat unifies the workflows that today require four browser tabs: discovery (TMDb), multi-source ratings (TMDb + IMDb + RT + Metacritic via OMDb), where-to-watch (TMDb watch providers), and a local watchlist that knows your streaming services. Flagship transcendence: `tonight` picks something well-rated that's actually streaming on your services; `ratings` shows the four canonical scores for any title; `marathon` totals runtime across a franchise.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `movie-goat-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-movie-goat` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install movie-goat
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install movie-goat --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install movie-goat --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install movie-goat --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install movie-goat --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/movie-goat/cmd/movie-goat-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/movie-goat-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install movie-goat --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-movie-goat --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-movie-goat --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install movie-goat --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/movie-goat-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `TMDB_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you. Add `OMDB_API_KEY` too if you want IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic enrichment in `ratings`, `versus`, and `career`.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/movie-goat/cmd/movie-goat-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "movie-goat": {
      "command": "movie-goat-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "TMDB_API_KEY": "<your-tmdb-key>",
        "OMDB_API_KEY": "<your-omdb-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

TMDb v3 API key (free, https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) is required and goes in `TMDB_API_KEY` — used as a query parameter, not a Bearer header. OMDb key (free, http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) is optional and goes in `OMDB_API_KEY`; without it, `ratings` and `versus` show TMDb-only and gracefully omit the IMDb/RT/Metacritic columns.

## Quick Start

```bash
# The fastest path to the value: a streaming-filtered, well-rated shortlist for tonight.
movie-goat-pp-cli tonight --providers "Netflix,Max" --region US

# Multi-type search across movies, TV, and people.
movie-goat-pp-cli multi "the bear"

# Cross-source rating card for Fight Club (TMDb id 550).
movie-goat-pp-cli ratings 550

# Add Inception to the local SQLite watchlist.
movie-goat-pp-cli watchlist add 27205 --kind movie

# Show which saved titles are streamable on your services right now.
movie-goat-pp-cli watchlist list --available --providers netflix,max --region US

# Plan a franchise marathon with totalled runtime.
movie-goat-pp-cli marathon "The Avengers" --order release

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cinephile rituals
- **`tonight`** — Pick what to watch tonight from trending titles actually streaming on your services.

  _Use this when an agent needs a streaming-filtered shortlist; one call replaces tab-bouncing across TMDb/RT/JustWatch._

  ```bash
  movie-goat-pp-cli tonight --mood thriller --max-runtime 120 --providers netflix,max --region US --json
  ```
- **`ratings`** — TMDb + IMDb + Rotten Tomatoes + Metacritic ratings for any title in one card.

  _Use when an agent needs the canonical multi-source rating for a title; degrades gracefully to TMDb-only if OMDB_API_KEY is unset._

  ```bash
  movie-goat-pp-cli ratings 550 --json
  ```
- **`marathon`** — Plan a franchise marathon with watch order, total runtime, and suggested breaks.

  _Use when planning an event watch; agent can dump the schedule to share with a group._

  ```bash
  movie-goat-pp-cli marathon "The Avengers" --order release --breaks-every 240 --json
  ```
- **`career`** — Explore any actor or director's full filmography with ratings and chronology.

  _Use when an agent needs a rated chronological filmography; replaces flat IMDb lists with cross-source ratings._

  ```bash
  movie-goat-pp-cli career "Christopher Nolan" --since 2010 --role director --json
  ```
- **`versus`** — Compare two movies or shows side-by-side across ratings, cast, runtime, and streaming.

  _Use when an agent has to pick between two finalists; one command shows where they differ on every axis._

  ```bash
  movie-goat-pp-cli versus 550 27205 --region US --json
  ```
- **`collaborators`** — List people who appear in 2+ of a person's credits, with count and titles.

  _Use when an agent is researching a filmmaker's circle; surfaces recurring DPs/composers/actors mechanically._

  ```bash
  movie-goat-pp-cli collaborators "Christopher Nolan" --min-count 3 --role crew --json
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`watchlist list`** — Local SQLite watchlist; flag rows that are streamable on your services.

  _Use weekly to surface streamable items from a saved list; eliminates ad-hoc JustWatch checks per title._

  ```bash
  movie-goat-pp-cli watchlist list --available --providers netflix,max --region US --json
  ```
- **`queue`** — Suggest next-watch picks derived from your watchlist's recommendations and similars.

  _Use when an agent needs a fresh queue derived from saved interests; combines local state with API recommendations._

  ```bash
  movie-goat-pp-cli queue --limit 20 --providers netflix,max --region US --json
  ```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
movie-goat-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/movie-goat-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:
- `TMDB_API_KEY`
- `OMDB_API_KEY` (optional; enables IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic enrichment)

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `movie-goat-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $TMDB_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 Unauthorized: "Invalid API key: You must be granted a valid key."** — TMDb v3 keys (32-char hex) must be sent as a query parameter, not as a Bearer header. The CLI does this automatically — re-check that TMDB_API_KEY is set to the v3 key from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api, not a v4 read access token.
- **`ratings` shows only the TMDb score and skips IMDb/RT/Metacritic columns.** — Set OMDB_API_KEY to a free key from http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx. Without it the CLI degrades to TMDb-only by design.
- **`watchlist list --available` returns rows but every row says `not available`.** — Pass `--region` (e.g. `--region US`) and confirm `--providers` matches TMDb's canonical provider names exactly (e.g. `"Netflix"`, `"Max"`, `"Amazon Prime Video"`). Use `movie-goat-pp-cli movies get <id> --select watch_providers` to see the canonical names for any title.
- **429 Too Many Requests when running `career` or `marathon` on long filmographies/collections.** — TMDb's rate limit is ~40 req/10s. The CLI's adaptive limiter ramps down on 429 automatically; rerun, and the ceiling will be discovered. For very long careers, use `--since YEAR` to scope the fan-out.
