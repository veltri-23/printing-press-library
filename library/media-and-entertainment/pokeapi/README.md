# PokéAPI CLI

**PokéAPI as a fully offline Pokédex with SQL, full-text search, type math, and a damage calculator no other Pokémon tool ships as a CLI.**

Most PokéAPI clients cache one request at a time. This CLI syncs the entire dataset to a local SQLite store and turns it into compound commands the live API can't answer: reverse ability search, move-effect filters, team partner suggestions, evolution-requirement reverse lookups, regional-form comparisons, and a Smogon-calc-style damage calculator. Plus all 98 endpoints, full-text search, and a SQL passthrough for whatever the typed commands don't cover.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `pokeapi-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-pokeapi` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pokeapi
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pokeapi --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pokeapi --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pokeapi --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pokeapi --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/pokeapi/cmd/pokeapi-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/pokeapi-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pokeapi --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-pokeapi --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-pokeapi --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pokeapi --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Authentication

PokéAPI is a public, read-only API. No keys, no tokens, no login. Run `pokeapi-pp-cli sync` once and you have the whole Pokédex on disk.

## Quick Start

```bash
# First — fetch every resource into the local SQLite store. Takes a few minutes; you only do this once per release of the API.
pokeapi-pp-cli sync

# Core agent-friendly profile: types, abilities, stats, key moves — one local query.
pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon profile pikachu --json

# Build a balanced team starting from a partial roster. Selects only the high-gravity fields.
pokeapi-pp-cli team suggest pikachu,charizard --slots 6 --json --select name,types,score

# Reverse search by effect — moves that paralyze a Steel-type. The live API can't do this in any single call.
pokeapi-pp-cli move find --effect paralyze --type-target steel --json

# Damage calculator — expected damage range factoring in STAB, type effectiveness, level, and stats.
pokeapi-pp-cli damage charizard blastoise hydro-pump --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local store that compounds
- **`pokemon by-ability`** — Find every Pokémon with a given ability. Live API has no reverse index — this is a single SQL query against the local store.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs to enumerate Pokémon by trait without making thousands of API calls._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon by-ability levitate --json --select name,types
  ```
- **`move find`** — Find moves by status effect, damage class, type, or target — e.g. all moves that paralyze a Steel-type.

  _Use this for battle planning questions framed by effect rather than by move name._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli move find --effect paralyze --type-target steel --json
  ```
- **`team suggest`** — Given an in-progress team, score every remaining Pokémon by how well it covers the team's typing gaps. Returns top candidates.

  _Best for team-building agents that need objective gap-coverage scoring rather than vibes-based recommendations._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli team suggest pikachu,charizard --slots 6 --json --select name,types,score
  ```
- **`pokemon diff-learnset`** — Compare the move learnsets of two Pokémon (often regional forms or megas) and surface what each can learn that the other cannot.

  _Useful when an agent needs to argue 'why pick form X over form Y' with concrete move evidence._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon diff-learnset charizard charizard-mega-x --json
  ```
- **`pokemon history`** — Show how a Pokémon has changed over generations: type changes, stat changes, ability changes, and which generation it was introduced in.

  _Reach for this when answering historical Pokémon questions ('was Clefairy always a Fairy type?')._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon history clefairy --json
  ```
- **`pokemon forms`** — List every form for a species (e.g. Vulpix vs Alolan Vulpix) with type, stat, and ability deltas inline.

  _Use when an agent needs a species-wide answer rather than a single-form payload._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon forms vulpix --json
  ```
- **`evolve into`** — Given a target Pokémon, surface the species you would need to evolve and the conditions (item, level, friendship, time of day) to get there.

  _Pick this when the user knows the Pokémon they want and needs the path to it, not the inverse._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli evolve into umbreon --json
  ```
- **`team gaps`** — List which of the 18 types your in-progress team has neither defensive resistance nor offensive super-effectiveness against.

  _Use when answering 'what would a hostile team most likely exploit on this lineup?'_

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli team gaps pikachu,charizard,blastoise --json
  ```
- **`encounters by-region`** — Render a region-level encounter table joining locations, areas, encounters, and species — every Pokémon you can find in (e.g.) Kanto.

  _When the question is regional ('what catches in Kanto?') rather than per-Pokémon._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli encounters by-region kanto --version red --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`search`** — Full-text search across Pokémon, moves, abilities, items, and locations — names plus flavor text — with relevance ranking.

  _Agent fallback when names are partial or fuzzy; replaces multiple list calls + grep._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli search "flame" --type move --limit 10 --json
  ```
- **`sql`** — Read-only SQL access to the local store. Power users and agents can compose joins the CLI doesn't expose directly.

  _Reach for this when a one-off question doesn't have a dedicated subcommand._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli sql "SELECT id FROM resources WHERE resource_type='pokemon' ORDER BY id LIMIT 10" --json
  ```

### Battle math
- **`damage`** — Compute expected damage range for a move from one Pokémon to another, factoring in STAB, type effectiveness, level, and base stats.

  _Reach for this on every battle-planning question framed as 'will it KO?' or 'how hard does X hit Y?'_

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli damage charizard blastoise hydro-pump --level1 50 --level2 50 --json
  ```
- **`pokemon top`** — Rank Pokémon by a base stat (attack, special-attack, speed, hp, etc.), optionally filtered by type. Returns the top N.

  _Use when learning the meta or filling a role on a team where the question is 'who's the best X-type at Y?'_

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon top --by special-attack --type ghost --limit 10 --json
  ```

- **`pokeapi-pp-cli type retrieve`** - Types are properties for Pokémon and their moves. Each type has three properties: which types of Pokémon it is super effective against, which types of Pokémon it is not very effective against, and which types of Pokémon it is completely ineffective against.

### version

Manage version

- **`pokeapi-pp-cli version game-list`** - Versions of the games, e.g., Red, Blue or Yellow.
- **`pokeapi-pp-cli version game-retrieve`** - Versions of the games, e.g., Red, Blue or Yellow.

### version-group

Manage version group

- **`pokeapi-pp-cli version-group retrieve`** - Version groups categorize highly similar versions of the games.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
pokeapi-pp-cli ability list

# JSON for scripting and agents
pokeapi-pp-cli ability list --json

# Filter to specific fields
pokeapi-pp-cli ability list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
pokeapi-pp-cli ability list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
pokeapi-pp-cli ability list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use as MCP Server

This CLI ships a companion MCP server for use with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add pokeapi pokeapi-pp-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pokeapi": {
      "command": "pokeapi-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Health Check

```bash
pokeapi-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/pokeapi-pp-cli/config.toml`

## Troubleshooting
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **Commands like `search` or `sql` return empty results.** — Run `pokeapi-pp-cli sync` first — these commands read from the local store.
- **Sync seems stuck on a single resource.** — PokéAPI is static-hosted and rarely fails, but a flaky network can stall. Re-run `pokeapi-pp-cli sync --resume` to pick up where you left off.
- **Sprite preview shows raw bytes.** — Pipe through `--ascii` for terminal-rendered art, or use `--out path.png` to save the binary.
- **A Pokémon name returns 'not found' but you spelled it right.** — PokéAPI uses dashed slugs — try `mr-mime`, `farfetchd`, or run `pokeapi-pp-cli search "<name>"` for a fuzzy match.
- **The damage calculator's numbers feel low compared to a real battle.** — The calc covers STAB + type + level + base stats. It does not model abilities, items, weather, terrain, or status — those need a full simulator like Pokémon Showdown.
