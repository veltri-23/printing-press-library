# Tella CLI

**Every Tella API operation behind one CLI, with a local SQLite store, FTS5 transcript search, and webhook tooling that replaces ngrok.**

Tella ships an API and an official MCP server; this CLI gives you both surfaces in one binary, plus a local-first store that makes cross-video transcript search, view-milestone rollups, and webhook replay actually fast. Every endpoint is a Cobra command, every command emits structured JSON, and every mutation supports --dry-run.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `tella-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-tella` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install tella
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install tella --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install tella --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install tella --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install tella --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/tella/cmd/tella-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/tella-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install tella --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-tella --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-tella --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install tella --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/tella-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `TELLA_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tella": {
      "command": "tella-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "TELLA_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Set TELLA_API_KEY to your Tella account API key (Account → Settings → API). Sent as Authorization: Bearer on every call. No OAuth, no refresh — it's a single static token.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Save your Tella API key to local config; used by every command.
tella-pp-cli auth set-token <token>

# Verify token + reachability before doing anything else.
tella-pp-cli doctor

# Sanity-check that you can see your workspace.
tella-pp-cli videos list --json --limit 5

# Populate the local SQLite store; required for transcript search and milestone digest.
tella-pp-cli sync

# Offline FTS5 search across every cached transcript.
tella-pp-cli transcripts search "pricing" --json

# Stream new webhook events to stdout; useful during integration development.
tella-pp-cli webhooks tail --follow

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local-first transcendence

- **`transcripts search`** — FTS5 search across every cached clip transcript in your workspace; returns video, clip, and timecode hits in milliseconds.

  _Use this when an agent or human needs to find every video that mentioned a topic without rehydrating the workspace from the API._

  ```bash
  tella-pp-cli transcripts search "pricing change" --json --limit 10
  ```

- **`videos viewed`** — Roll up webhook view-milestone events into a per-video summary over a window (e.g. who crossed 75% in the last 7 days).

  _Use this in a sales follow-up loop to triage prospects by engagement without scanning the dashboard._

  ```bash
  tella-pp-cli videos viewed --since 7d --milestone 75 --json
  ```

- **`workspace stats`** — Local aggregate of video count, clip count, total duration, transcript word count, and export count by month across the cached workspace.

  _Use this for monthly creator-economy reports without dashboard scraping._

  ```bash
  tella-pp-cli workspace stats --json
  ```

### Webhook tooling

- **`webhooks tail`** — Stream new webhook events from the inbox to stdout, and replay any prior message to a local URL with valid HMAC headers — no public tunnel needed.

  _Use this when developing a webhook handler against Tella without exposing localhost via a tunnel._

  ```bash
  tella-pp-cli webhooks tail --follow --json
  ```

### Bulk operations

- **`clips edit-pass`** — Apply a chained set of edits (remove-fillers, remove-buffers, trim-edges, trim-silences-gt N, find-mistakes [unofficial]) across every clip in a playlist in one command.

  _Use this to apply a creator's standard edit pass across an entire playlist without per-clip clicking._

  ```bash
  tella-pp-cli clips edit-pass --playlist plst_42 --remove-fillers --remove-buffers --trim-edges --dry-run
  ```

  Per-clip primitives also available individually:
  - `videos clips cut <vid> <clipId> --range 2000:3500 --range 8000:9200` — cut multiple time ranges in one request.
  - `videos clips cut-by-transcript <vid> <clipId> --word-range 12:17` — cut by uncut-transcript word indices; Tella resolves exact word timing.
  - `videos clips remove-buffers <vid> <clipId> [--min-ms N]` — UI-button equivalent: cuts every silence ≥ `N` ms (default 200). Public API only.
  - `videos clips trim-edges <vid> <clipId>` — narrow primitive: cuts only the head and tail silences. Public API only.
  - `videos clips find-mistakes <vid> <clipId> --unofficial` — AI mistake detection via Tella's web-app endpoint. **Unofficial API; cookie-auth required.** See the "Unofficial API: Find Mistakes" section below.

- **`sources upload-file` + `videos clips add`** — Create a Tella source, upload local video bytes to the pre-signed URL, then add that source as a new clip.

  ```bash
  tella-pp-cli sources upload-file intro.mp4 --width 1920 --height 1080 --duration 42.5 --json
  tella-pp-cli videos clips add vid_abc --source-id src_123 --name Intro --json
  ```

#### Unofficial API: Find Mistakes

Tella's web UI exposes an AI-driven "Find mistakes" button on the Cut panel. That endpoint is **not part of the public API** (verified 404 against `api.tella.com` on 2026-05-16), so `find-mistakes` opts into the same internal endpoint the web app uses. It requires a session cookie copied from a logged-in browser.

```bash
# 1) Open tella.tv in Chrome, DevTools → Application → Cookies → tella.tv.
#    Right-click a row → Copy → Copy as cURL → take the value after "Cookie:".
# 2) Set the env var to the raw cookie header value (NOT prefixed with "Cookie:"):
export TELLA_SESSION_COOKIE='__Secure-Tella.session=...; XSRF-TOKEN=...'

# 3) Run with --unofficial:
tella-pp-cli videos clips find-mistakes vid_abc cl_xyz --unofficial --json
```

Detection step uses cookie auth against `prod-stream.tella.tv` (Server-Sent Events). Apply step uses the documented public `/v1/.../cut` endpoint (Bearer auth, additive — coexists with `--remove-buffers` and friends). Cookie expires periodically; refresh from DevTools when you see HTTP 401.

> **Warning:** the unofficial AI service can change or break without notice. The CLI prints a fresh error message pointing you back to DevTools whenever the cookie returns 401. This auth surface is intentionally opt-in (`--unofficial`) so accidental shell usage doesn't hit a deprecated/unstable endpoint.

- **`exports wait`** — Kick off exports for one or more videos and block until each is ready, short-circuiting on the Export ready webhook event.

  _Use this in batch publishing scripts that need export URLs for downstream uploads._

  ```bash
  tella-pp-cli exports wait --video vid_1 --video vid_2 --timeout 10m --json
  ```

### Transcript tooling

- **`clips transcript-diff`** — Diff a clip's cut transcript against its uncut transcript to surface every word that editing removed (filler, silence, hand-edit) with timecodes.

  _Use this to audit what an automated edit pass actually changed before publishing._

  ```bash
  tella-pp-cli clips transcript-diff clp_abc --json
  ```

- **`clips captions`** — Format a clip's cut transcript as an SRT or VTT subtitle file ready to attach to an embed or upload.

  _Use this to ship caption files alongside video embeds without round-tripping through a separate caption tool._

  ```bash
  tella-pp-cli clips captions clp_abc --format srt > captions.srt
  ```

## Usage

Run `tella-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Novel editing workflows

These commands compose Tella's public edit primitives into agent-safe workflows:

```bash
# Upload a local file and add it as a new clip.
tella-pp-cli videos clips insert-file vid_abc intro.mp4 --width 1920 --height 1080 --duration 42.5 --dry-run

# Upload B-roll and attach it as layout media over a time range.
tella-pp-cli videos clips add-broll vid_abc cl_xyz broll.mp4 --width 1920 --height 1080 --duration 8.2 --start-ms 4000 --duration-ms 6000 --dry-run

# Clean a clip, then roll back cuts if needed.
tella-pp-cli videos clips clean vid_abc cl_xyz --remove-fillers --remove-buffers --trim-edges --dry-run
tella-pp-cli videos clips clean vid_abc cl_xyz --remove-fillers --remove-buffers --trim-edges --apply
tella-pp-cli videos clips undo-last-cuts vid_abc cl_xyz --dry-run

# Inspect edit substrate, then cut transcript words or replace word ranges.
tella-pp-cli videos clips silence-map vid_abc cl_xyz --json
tella-pp-cli videos clips cut-words vid_abc cl_xyz --term "mistake" --dry-run
tella-pp-cli videos clips replace-word-ranges vid_abc cl_xyz --word-ranges '[{"fromWordIndex":12,"toWordIndex":17}]' --dry-run

# Restore exact cuts explicitly.
tella-pp-cli videos clips restore-cuts vid_abc cl_xyz --cuts '[{"fromMs":100,"toMs":250}]' --dry-run

# Export/apply a full video edit plan.
tella-pp-cli videos storyboard vid_abc --include-transcript --json > storyboard.json
tella-pp-cli videos apply-storyboard vid_abc --file storyboard.json --dry-run

# Presets, QA, and playlist-scale edit planning.
tella-pp-cli videos format vid_abc --preset shorts --dry-run
tella-pp-cli videos audit vid_abc --json
tella-pp-cli playlists edit-pass plst_42 --remove-fillers --remove-buffers --trim-edges --dry-run
```

Commands default to dry-run/plan mode when they perform compound edits; pass each command's `--apply` flag where available, or drop global `--dry-run`, only after reviewing the emitted plan.

tella-pp-cli playlists list

# JSON for scripting and agents
tella-pp-cli playlists list --json

# Filter to specific fields
tella-pp-cli playlists list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
tella-pp-cli playlists list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
tella-pp-cli playlists list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
tella-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/tella-public-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name            | Kind     | Required | Description                 |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `TELLA_API_KEY` | per_call | Yes      | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**

- Run `tella-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $TELLA_API_KEY`
  **Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 Unauthorized on every call** — Re-fetch your API key at tella.tv → Account → Settings → API and run `tella-pp-cli auth set-token <token>` again.
- **Empty results from `transcripts search --data-source local`** — Run `tella-pp-cli sync` first to populate the local transcripts table.
- **`webhooks tail` shows no events** — Confirm a webhook endpoint is registered (`tella-pp-cli webhooks endpoint create`); the inbox only collects events for registered endpoints.
- **`clips edit-pass --dry-run` shows zero planned mutations** — Default short-circuits before fetching anything; the empty plan is by design. Drop `--dry-run` to see real planning (and use `--apply` to actually fire).
- **`--remove-buffers` plans cuts but `--trim-silences-gt 1s` plans none** — The `--trim-silences-gt` flag wants silences ≥ N; if every silence is shorter than your threshold the plan is empty. Use `videos clips get-silences <id> <clipId>` to inspect raw ranges, or rely on `--remove-buffers` (default 200 ms threshold).
- **`find-mistakes` returns HTTP 401** — Your `TELLA_SESSION_COOKIE` expired. Refresh from Chrome DevTools → Application → Cookies → tella.tv → copy the cookie row back into the env var. The unofficial AI host (`prod-stream.tella.tv`) does NOT accept the public-API Bearer token.
- **Export wait times out** — Default timeout is 10m. Long videos can exceed; pass `--timeout 30m` and ensure the Export ready webhook endpoint is registered for early termination.
