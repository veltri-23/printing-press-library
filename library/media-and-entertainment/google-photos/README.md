## Install

The recommended path installs both the `google-photos-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-google-photos` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install google-photos
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install google-photos --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install google-photos --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install google-photos --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install google-photos --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/google-photos/cmd/google-photos-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/google-photos-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install google-photos --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-google-photos --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-google-photos --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install google-photos --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

The bundle reuses your local OAuth tokens — authenticate first if you haven't:

```bash
google-photos-pp-cli auth login --client-id "$GOOGLE_PHOTOS_CLIENT_ID"
```

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/google-photos-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `GOOGLE_PHOTOS_TOKEN` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/google-photos/cmd/google-photos-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-photos": {
      "command": "google-photos-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_PHOTOS_TOKEN": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Authenticate

Authorize via your browser:

```bash
google-photos-pp-cli auth login --client-id "$GOOGLE_PHOTOS_CLIENT_ID"
```

This opens a browser window to complete the OAuth2 flow. Your tokens are stored locally and refreshed automatically.
For multiple Google accounts, pass an account email and select it later:

```bash
google-photos-pp-cli auth login you@example.com --client-id "$GOOGLE_PHOTOS_CLIENT_ID"
google-photos-pp-cli auth list
google-photos-pp-cli auth use you@example.com
google-photos-pp-cli --account you@example.com albums list
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
google-photos-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration and credentials.

### 4. Try Your First Command

```bash
google-photos-pp-cli albums list
```

## Google Photos Scope Limits

Google Photos Library API read and edit scopes are limited to app-created albums and media. Use Library API commands here for app-created content, uploads, and album/media management. Use Picker commands when a user needs to select media from their broader Google Photos library.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
google-photos-pp-cli albums list

# JSON for scripting and agents
google-photos-pp-cli albums list --json

# Filter to specific fields
google-photos-pp-cli albums list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
google-photos-pp-cli albums list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
google-photos-pp-cli albums list --agent

# Command guard — permit only selected command families
google-photos-pp-cli --enable-commands albums.list albums list --agent

# Command guard — block specific risky commands
google-photos-pp-cli --disable-commands picker.delete-session picker delete-session SESSION_ID --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Retryable** - creates return "already exists" on retry, deletes return "already deleted"
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set
- **Guarded** - `--enable-commands` and `--disable-commands` restrict runtime command execution with dotted command paths
- **Introspectable** - `schema` and `agent-context` expose commands, flags, auth account selection, and safety policy as JSON

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Safety Profiles

The stock binary allows every command unless runtime guards are provided:

```bash
google-photos-pp-cli --enable-commands albums.list,media-items.get albums list --agent
google-photos-pp-cli --disable-commands picker.delete-session picker delete-session SESSION_ID --agent
```

For agent or MCP deployments that need stronger local guardrails, build a baked profile. Baked profiles are compiled into the binary and cannot be loosened by command-line flags:

```bash
make build-readonly
make build-agent-safe
make build-mcp-readonly
make build-mcp-agent-safe
```

`safety_readonly` permits read/list/search/export/schema-style commands and blocks Google Photos mutations. `safety_agent_safe` permits reads and local archive/search workflows while blocking auth writes, uploads, creates, patches, deletes, and album/media mutations.

## Health Check

```bash
google-photos-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/google-photos-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:
- `GOOGLE_PHOTOS_TOKEN`
- `GOOGLE_PHOTOS_ACCOUNT`
- `GOOGLE_PHOTOS_ENABLE_COMMANDS`
- `GOOGLE_PHOTOS_DISABLE_COMMANDS`

OAuth account selection order:
1. `--account <email>`
2. `GOOGLE_PHOTOS_ACCOUNT`
3. `default_account` from `auth use`
4. legacy single-token fields in the config file

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `google-photos-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $GOOGLE_PHOTOS_TOKEN`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items
