# archive-is-pp-cli

Bypass paywalls and look up web archives via archive.today. Looks up existing snapshots before submitting new ones to save time and avoid rate limits. Extracts clean markdown from archived pages for piping into LLMs. Falls back to Wayback Machine automatically when archive.today is blocked or rate-limited.

**Primary use case:** "I want to read an article that's behind a paywall."

> **About archive.today:** On February 21, 2026, Wikipedia formally blacklisted archive.today after evidence of DDoS activity and snapshot tampering. This CLI is intended for personal paywall reading. Do NOT use it for legal evidence, academic citation, or anything requiring a trustworthy archive — use the Wayback Machine for that. This CLI ships with Wayback as a built-in fallback backend for that reason.

Created by [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn) (Matt Van Horn).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `archive-is-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-archive-is` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install archive-is
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install archive-is --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install archive-is --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install archive-is --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install archive-is --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/archive-is/cmd/archive-is-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/archive-is-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install archive-is --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-archive-is --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-archive-is --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install archive-is --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Verify Setup

```bash
archive-is-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration.

### 3. Read a paywalled article

```bash
# Find an existing archive (or create one), copy URL to clipboard
archive-is-pp-cli read https://www.nytimes.com/2026/04/10/article

# Pipe the article text straight into Claude
archive-is-pp-cli get https://www.nytimes.com/2026/04/10/article | claude "summarize this article"

# See every historical snapshot
archive-is-pp-cli history https://www.nytimes.com/

# Request an archive for a URL that isn't archived yet, and wait for it
archive-is-pp-cli request https://example.com/fresh-url --wait --json
```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

- **`get`** — Fetch the archived page and extract clean markdown text — ready to pipe into Claude, LLMs, or notes.
- **`read`** — Find existing snapshot with timegate first, submit only if nothing recent exists. Saves 60+ seconds per hit and avoids rate limits.
- **`read`** — Automatically retry across archive.ph, archive.md, archive.is, archive.fo, and other mirrors when one is blocked or rate-limited.
- **`read`** — When archive.is fails or is rate-limited, automatically try Wayback Machine. Hedges the February 2026 archive.today reputation risk.
- **`search`** — Full-text search across your past archive reads — find that article you saved last month without remembering the URL.
- **`bulk`** — Archive a list of URLs from a file or stdin, with built-in 10-second gaps and exponential backoff on 429s. Run it and walk away.

## Paywall Reader Workflow

The six hand-built commands below are the hero features. They're optimized for one workflow: hit a paywalled URL, get the readable version back.

| Command | What it does | When to use it |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `read <url>` | Find existing archive (timegate) or create one. Copies URL to clipboard. | Default. Hit a paywall, run this, paste into browser. |
| `get <url>` | Same as read but fetches the article HTML and extracts clean text. | Pipe into LLMs, notes, or read in the terminal. Falls back to Wayback on CAPTCHA. |
| `history <url>` | List every known snapshot of the URL, oldest to newest. | Researchers tracking article changes. Also: 12,312 NYT homepage snapshots back to 1996. |
| `save <url>` | Force a fresh capture, bypassing the dedup window. | When you need the current version preserved before it changes. Slower (30-120s). |
| `request <url>` | Fire a capture request, optionally wait for it to be ready. | Submit-and-forget, or `--wait` for agent workflows that need to know when it's done. |
| `bulk <file>` | Archive a list of URLs with built-in rate limiting. | Save a reading list. 10-second gaps between requests by default. |

**Why lookup-before-submit matters:** `read` hits the Memento timegate endpoint first (< 500ms). Only if there's no recent snapshot does it submit a fresh capture (30-120s). Every other CLI for archive.today submits on every call, wasting 60+ seconds per URL and triggering rate limits.

**Why dual-backend fallback matters:** archive.today frequently serves CAPTCHA challenges for direct body fetches. `get` and `read` automatically fall back to the Wayback Machine when that happens. You never have to think about it.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable default (URL on stdout, metadata on stderr)
archive-is-pp-cli read https://www.nytimes.com/2026/04/10/article

# JSON for scripting and agents
archive-is-pp-cli read https://www.nytimes.com/2026/04/10/article --json

# Filter to specific fields
archive-is-pp-cli history https://example.com --json --select memento_url,captured_at

# Dry run — show the request without sending
archive-is-pp-cli read https://www.nytimes.com/2026/04/10/article --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
archive-is-pp-cli read https://www.nytimes.com/2026/04/10/article --agent

# Quiet mode — one memento URL per line (perfect for xargs)
archive-is-pp-cli history https://www.nytimes.com/ --quiet
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Retryable** - creates return "already exists" on retry, deletes return "already deleted"
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - `echo '{"key":"value"}' | archive-is-pp-cli <resource> create --stdin`
- **Cacheable** - GET responses cached for 5 minutes, bypass with `--no-cache`
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set
- **Progress events** - paginated commands emit NDJSON events to stderr in default mode

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use as MCP Server

This CLI ships a companion MCP server for use with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add archive-is archive-is-pp-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archive-is": {
      "command": "archive-is-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Cookbook

Real recipes built from the commands this CLI actually ships.

```bash
# 1. Read a paywalled article, copy the archive URL to the clipboard
archive-is-pp-cli read https://www.nytimes.com/2026/04/10/some-article

# 2. Summarize a paywalled article with Claude
archive-is-pp-cli get https://www.nytimes.com/2026/04/10/some-article \
  | claude "summarize this in three bullet points"

# 3. Fetch the raw HTML of the archived page
archive-is-pp-cli get https://example.com/article --raw > page.html

# 4. Show every snapshot ever taken of a homepage (timemap)
archive-is-pp-cli history https://www.nytimes.com/ --json \
  | jq '.snapshots[] | {captured_at, memento_url}'

# 5. Force a fresh capture before a page changes or disappears
archive-is-pp-cli save https://example.com/about --force

# 6. Submit an archive request and poll until it is ready (agent workflow)
archive-is-pp-cli request https://ft.com/content/xyz --wait --wait-timeout 3m --json

# 7. Fire-and-forget: submit now, check back later
archive-is-pp-cli request https://example.com/article
archive-is-pp-cli request check https://example.com/article

# 8. Archive a reading list with built-in rate limiting
archive-is-pp-cli bulk reading-list.txt --delay 15s

# 9. Pipe URLs from stdin instead of a file
grep -oE 'https?://[^ )]+' notes.md | archive-is-pp-cli bulk -

# 10. Prefer the archive.today mirror but fall back to Wayback automatically
archive-is-pp-cli read https://ft.com/content/xyz --backend archive-is,wayback

# 11. Get just the newest snapshot of a URL
archive-is-pp-cli snapshots newest https://example.com --json

# 12. Sync metadata from the global recent-archives feed for offline analysis
archive-is-pp-cli sync --full
archive-is-pp-cli workflow status

# 13. Export your local archive index for backup
archive-is-pp-cli export --format jsonl > archive-backup.jsonl

# 14. Check archive-is-pp-cli's auth and API reachability
archive-is-pp-cli doctor --json
```

## Health Check

```bash
$ archive-is-pp-cli doctor
  OK Config: ok
  WARN Auth: not required
  OK API: reachable
  config_path: /Users/you/.config/archive-is-pp-cli/config.toml
  base_url: https://archive.ph
  version: 1.0.0
```

archive.today has no API key — "not required" is the expected auth status. If `API: reachable` fails, archive.ph may be rate-limiting your IP or serving a CAPTCHA. The CLI will transparently fall back to other mirrors (archive.md, archive.is, archive.fo, archive.li, archive.vn) and, for body fetches, to the Wayback Machine.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/archive-is-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ARCHIVE_IS_CONFIG` | Path to an alternative config file | `~/.config/archive-is-pp-cli/config.toml` |
| `ARCHIVE_IS_BASE_URL` | Override the primary mirror used for timegate and submit | `https://archive.ph` |

archive.today requires no authentication — there is no API key to set.

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `archive-is-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials

**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

**Rate limit errors (exit code 7)**
- The CLI auto-retries with exponential backoff
- If persistent, wait a few minutes and try again

## Agent workflow features

This CLI was patched to add these agent-workflow capabilities (see [`printing-press patch`](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/pull/221)):

- **Named profiles** — save a set of flags under a name and reuse them: `archive-is-pp-cli profile save <name> --<flag> <value>`, then `archive-is-pp-cli --profile <name> <command>`. Flag precedence: explicit flag > env var > profile > default.
- **`--deliver`** — route command output to a sink other than stdout. Values: `file:<path>` writes atomically via tmp+rename; `webhook:<url>` POSTs as JSON (or NDJSON with `--compact`).
- **`feedback`** — record in-band feedback about the CLI. Entries append as JSON lines to `~/.archive-is-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. When `ARCHIVE_IS_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set and either `--send` is passed or `ARCHIVE_IS_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`, the entry is also POSTed upstream.
