# AllTrails Top-4 Checkpoint

Updated: 2026-05-27T20:10:00Z

Status: complete for the Top-4 lane. The broader 12-venue goal is not complete.

## What Is Done

- Personal repo: `<personal-repo>/alltrails-cli`
- PP package: `library/travel/alltrails`
- Browser/API map: `api-map/browser-cdp-routes-2026-05-26.json`
- Personal CLI is live read/write capable by default with `--dry-run` as opt-in preview.
- PP-side writes are gated by `ALLTRAILS_PP_ALLOW_WRITES=1`, and write commands default to dry-run when not explicitly live.
- MCP tools carry read/write risk metadata, and endpoint docs include mutation labeling.
- PP upload staging is ready: `publish package --target` produced `publish-staging/alltrails-pp-final-2026-05-27/library/travel/alltrails`, with manuscripts included, no root binaries, and staged `publish validate` passing.

## Evidence

- Authenticated Chrome CDP captures: `proofs/cdp-alltrails-california-sanitized-2026-05-26.json`, `proofs/cdp-alltrails-account-sanitized-2026-05-26.json`
- Browser route map: `api-map/browser-cdp-routes-2026-05-26.json`
- Community/API research: `research/community-api-inventory-2026-05-26.md`
- PP proof set includes go test/vet, verify, verify-skill, tools-audit, and shipcheck 6/6.
- Final PP upload proofs: `proofs/pp-publish-validate-final-mirror-2026-05-27.json`, `proofs/pp-publish-package-final-mirror-2026-05-27.json`, `proofs/pp-publish-validate-staged-final-2026-05-27.json`, `proofs/pp-go-test-staged-final-2026-05-27.txt`.

## Boundary

No live AllTrails mutation was submitted in this checkpoint. Live write capability exists, but recorded write proofs are dry-run/gated.
