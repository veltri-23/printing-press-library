// PATCH(amend-2026-05-20: value-compare) — Program registry for the
// pluggable valuation seam. v1 ships ProgramAtmos only; adding more
// airlines later (United, AAdvantage, etc.) is a single struct-literal
// append in the registry slice below.

// Package valuation looks up cents-per-point values for loyalty programs
// from external sources (currently The Points Guy's monthly valuations
// page), caches them on disk, and computes apples-to-apples cash-vs-
// points comparison math.

// Program is a typed slug identifying a loyalty program.
