// PATCH(library): airport alias table for IATA codes that have been retired
// or replaced. Google's GetShoppingResults silently returns an empty payload
// for decommissioned codes, so a CLI that passes the raw user input gets
// zero results with no signal that anything is wrong. This table is the
// fix at the request edge: substitute the current code before the call,
// surface the substitution in the response envelope (see SearchResult.AirportRemapped).
//
// Entries are added when a route stops returning results because its IATA
// code changed. Keep the map sorted by key for review readability.
//
//   PNH -> KTI: Phnom Penh International closed September 2025, replaced by
//               Techo International Airport. Google migrated to KTI.
//   REP -> SAI: Siem Reap International replaced by Siem Reap-Angkor
//               International (SAI) in 2024.
