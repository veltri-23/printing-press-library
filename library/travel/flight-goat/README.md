# Flight Goat CLI

# Introduction

Flight Goat is a consumer-flight decision CLI first, and a FlightAware/AeroAPI wrapper second.

Its primary job is to answer practical flight questions from the terminal:

- **Find real fares** with Google Flights for one-way, round-trip, and multi-city trips.
- **Scan date ranges** to find cheaper travel dates between airports.
- **Explore nonstop and long-haul routes** from an airport using Kayak's route data.
- **Compare price against operational risk** by joining fare results with reliability, delay, weather, and tracking context when you have a FlightAware AeroAPI key.
- **Produce agent-friendly JSON** for travel planning, monitoring, rebooking, and briefing workflows.

Most fare-discovery commands are free and require no account. AeroAPI is optional: add it when you need live flight status, historical reliability, airport delays, alerts, tail/aircraft lookups, or Foresight-backed predictions.

## Headline commands

These are the commands to try first:

```bash
# Search Google Flights for a specific itinerary. Free; no API key required.
flight-goat-pp-cli flights SEA LHR 2026-06-15 --sort cheapest

# Find the cheapest dates across a window. Free; no API key required.
flight-goat-pp-cli dates JFK CDG --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-31 --sort

# Explore nonstop destinations from an airport via Kayak route data. Free; no API key required.
flight-goat-pp-cli explore SEA --agent

# Filter nonstop destinations by long-haul duration. Free; no API key required.
flight-goat-pp-cli longhaul SEA --min-hours 8 --agent

# Join fares with reliability and delay context. Uses AeroAPI when configured.
flight-goat-pp-cli compare SEA LHR 2026-06-15 --agent

# Decide whether a delayed flight is route-wide, airport-wide, or flight-specific.
flight-goat-pp-cli assess --origin SFO --destination DCA --delayed-flight UA123 --agent
```

## Data sources and credentials

| Capability | Source | Credential |
|---|---|---|
| Fare search, cheapest dates, Google Flights links | Google Flights native backend | None |
| Nonstop destination and long-haul route discovery | Kayak route data | None |
| Live status, airport delays, disruption counts, aircraft/tail lookups, route reliability, alerts, history, Foresight | FlightAware AeroAPI | Optional `FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH` |
| Compound decisions like `compare`, `assess`, `digest`, `monitor`, and `ontime-now` | Google Flights/Kayak plus AeroAPI/FAA/weather where relevant | Partial results without every source; AeroAPI improves operational depth |

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `flight-goat-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-flight-goat` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install flight-goat
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install flight-goat --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install flight-goat --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install flight-goat --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install flight-goat --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/travel/flight-goat/cmd/flight-goat-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/flight-goat-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install flight-goat --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-flight-goat --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-flight-goat --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install flight-goat --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/flight-goat-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/travel/flight-goat/cmd/flight-goat-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flight-goat": {
      "command": "flight-goat-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Try the free fare commands

Most headline fare and route-discovery commands do not need credentials:

```bash
flight-goat-pp-cli flights SEA LHR 2026-06-15 --sort cheapest
flight-goat-pp-cli dates JFK CDG --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-31 --sort
flight-goat-pp-cli explore SEA --agent
```

### 3. Add AeroAPI only for operational data

Set `FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH` when you need FlightAware-backed status, reliability, alerts, history, aircraft/tail, disruption, or Foresight commands.

```bash
export FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH="<paste-your-key>"
```

You can also persist this in your config file at `~/.config/flight-goat-pp-cli/config.toml`.

### 4. Verify Setup

```bash
flight-goat-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your CLI configuration and reports whether optional AeroAPI credentials are available.

## Usage

Run `flight-goat-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

### Delay Assessment

Use `assess` when a user has a delayed flight or route and needs to decide
whether the problem is airport-wide, destination-wide, or specific to one
operator/aircraft.

```bash
flight-goat-pp-cli assess --origin SFO --destination DCA --delayed-flight UA123 --agent
flight-goat-pp-cli assess --origin KSFO --destination KJFK --depart-after 18:00 --no-prices --agent
```

The report joins AeroAPI airport delays, disruption counts, weather, route
alternatives, delayed-flight and inbound-aircraft status, FAA NAS Status, and
optional Google Flights price context. Failed upstream calls are returned in
`sources` and `decision.missing_evidence` so partial reports are explicit.
Raw AeroAPI payloads are omitted by default; add `--include-raw` when an agent
needs the original JSON for audit or custom scoring. FAA NOTAM data is not
included yet.

### Google Flights Currency

Google Flights price commands accept `--currency <ISO-4217-code>` for native
Google Flights prices in that currency. The default is USD when the flag is
omitted.

```bash
flight-goat-pp-cli flights MAN AGP 2026-05-10 --currency GBP --sort=cheapest
flight-goat-pp-cli dates JFK CDG --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-31 --currency EUR --sort
flight-goat-pp-cli compare SEA LHR 2026-06-15 --currency GBP
```

`--currency` is intentionally command-scoped. It is available on commands that
ask Google Flights for prices (`flights`, `dates`, `compare`, `gf-search`, and
`cheapest-longhaul`), not on AeroAPI or Kayak-only commands.

## Commands

### aircraft

Manage aircraft

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli aircraft get-flight-type`** - Returns information about an aircraft type, given an ICAO aircraft type designator string.
Data returned includes the description, type, manufacturer, engine type, and engine
count.

### airports

Manage airports

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli airports get`** - Returns information about an airport given an ICAO or LID airport code
such as KLAX, KIAH, O07, etc. Data returned includes airport name,
city, state (when known), latitude, longitude, and timezone.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli airports get-all`** - Returns the ICAO identifiers of all known airports. For airports that
do not have an ICAO identifier, the FAA LID identifier will be used.
Links for further information about each airport are included.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli airports get-delays-for-all`** - Returns a list of airports with delays. There may be multiple reasons
returned per airport if there are multiple types of delays reported at
an airport. Note that individual flights can be delayed without there
being an airport-wide delay returned by this endpoint.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli airports get-nearby`** - Returns a list of airports located within a given distance from the
given location.

### alerts

AeroAPI alerting can be used to configure and receive real-time alerts on key flight
events. With customizable alerting offered by our alert endpoints, AeroAPI empowers
users to selectively pick various types of events/filters to alert on. By doing so,
you can receive specially tailored alerts delivered to you for events such as flight plan
filed, flight departure (out and off), flight arrival (on and in), and more!

To get started with alerting, the **PUT /alerts/endpoint** endpoint must first be used
to set up the account-wide default URL that alerts will be delivered to. This step must
be done before any alerts can be configured and will serve as the fallback URL that all
alerts will be sent to for the account if a specific delivery URL is not designated on a
particular alert. If this is not performed before configuring alerts, then you will
receive a 400 error with an error message reminding you of this step when trying to interact
with the **POST /alerts** endpoint. Once a URL is set via the **PUT /alerts/endpoint** endpoint,
then alerts can be configured using the **POST /alerts** endpoint. The **GET /alerts** endpoint
can also be used to retrieve all currently configured alerts associated with your AeroAPI key.
The **GET /alerts** endpoint will allow you to easily retrieve the id of any specific alerts of
interest configured for the account which can let you use the **GET** **PUT** and **DELETE**
**/alerts/{id}** endpoints to retrieve, update, and delete specific alerts.

When configuring an individual alert, the *target_url* field can be set to a URL that’s
different than the account-wide target endpoint set via the **PUT /alerts/endpoint**. If
the *target_url* field is set on an alert, then that specific alert will be delivered to
the specified *target_url* rather than the default account-wide one. If this field is not
configured for the alert, then the alert will be delivered to the default account-wide endpoint.
By setting this field, one can easily target different alerts to be received by different endpoints
which can be useful for configuring per-application alerts or sending alerts to an alternate
development environment without having to adjust a production alert configuration.

For each alert configured, one-to-many ‘events’ can be set for alert delivery. While most
events will result in one alert delivery, both the *arrival* and the *departure* events can
result in multiple alerts delivered (referred to as bundled). The *departure* event bundles the
departure (actual OFF the ground) alert, along with the flight plan filed alert and up to 5
per-departure changes which can include alerts for significant departure delays of over
30 minutes, gate changes, and airport delays. FlightAware Global customers will
also receive *Power on* and *Ready to taxi* alerts as part of the departure bundle. The *arrival* event
bundles the arrival (actual ON the ground) alert, along with up to 5 en-route changes (including delays
of over 30 minutes and excluding diversions) identified. FlightAware Global customers will also receive
*taxi stop* times as part of the *arrival* bundle. Setting a bundled type and unbundled type for an
On/Off will only result in a single alert in the case where events may overlap.

If there is a need to change the alert configurations, updating an alert using the **PUT /alerts/{id}**
endpoint and a unique alert identifier (id) is preferred rather than creating an additional alert.
By doing so, you can avoid duplicate alerts being delivered which could create unnecessary noise
if they are not of interest anymore.

If at any point there is a need to delete an alert, the **DELETE alerts/{id}** endpoint can be
leveraged to delete an alert so that it won’t be delivered anymore. As a reminder, specific alert
IDs can be retrieved from the **GET /alerts** endpoint.

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli alerts create`** - Create a new AeroAPI flight alert. When the alert is triggered, a
callback mechanism will be used to notify the address set via the
/alerts/endpoint endpoint. Each callback will be charged as a query and
count towards usage for the AeroAPI key that created the alert. If this key
is disabled or removed, the alert will no longer be available.
If a target_url is provided, then this specific alert will be delivered
to that address regardless of the adress set via the /alerts/endpoint endpoint.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli alerts delete`** - Deletes specific alert with given ID
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli alerts delete-endpoint`** - Remove the default account-wide URL that will be POSTed to for alerts that are
not configured with a specific URL. This means that any alerts that are not configured
with a specific URL will not be delivered.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli alerts get`** - Returns the configuration data for an alert with the specified ID.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli alerts get-all`** - Returns all configured alerts for the FlightAware account (this
includes alerts configured through other means by the FlightAware user
owning the AeroAPI account like FlightAware's website or mobile apps).
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli alerts get-endpoint`** - Returns URL that will be POSTed to for alerts that are delivered via AeroAPI.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli alerts set-endpoint`** - Updates the default URL that will be POSTed to for alerts that are delivered via AeroAPI.
This sets the account-wide default URL that all alerts will be delivered to unless
the specific alert has a different delivery address configured for it.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli alerts update`** - Modifies the configuration for an alert with the specified ID. If a target
URL address is provided, then the alert will be delivered to that address
even if it is different than the default account-wide address set through
the alerts/endpoint endpoint. Updating an alert that was created with a
different AeroAPI key is possible, but will not change the AeroAPI key that
the alert is associated with for usage.

### disruption-counts

Manage disruption counts

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli disruption-counts get`** - Returns flight cancellation/delay counts in the specified time period
for a particular airline or airport.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli disruption-counts get-all`** - Returns overall flight cancellation/delay counts in the specified time
period for either all airlines or all airports.

### flights

Manage flights

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli flights get`** - Returns the flight info status summary for a registration, ident, or
fa_flight_id.  If a fa_flight_id is specified then a maximum of 1
flight is returned, unless the flight has been diverted in which case
both the original flight and any diversions will be returned with a
duplicate fa_flight_id. If a registration or ident is specified,
approximately 14 days of recent and scheduled flight information is
returned, ordered by `scheduled_out` (or `scheduled_off` if
`scheduled_out` is missing) descending. Alternately, specify a start
and end parameter to find your flight(s) of interest, including up to
10 days of flight history.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli flights get-by-advanced-search`** - Returns currently or recently airborne flights based on geospatial
search parameters.

Query parameters include a latitude/longitude box, aircraft ident with
wildcards, type with wildcards, prefix, origin airport,
destination airport, origin or destination airport, groundspeed, and
altitude. It takes search terms in a single string comprising of
{operator key value} elements and returns an array of flight
structures. Each search term must be enclosed in curly braces. Multiple
search terms can be combined in an implicit boolean "and" by separating
the terms with at least one space. This function only searches flight
data representing approximately the last 24 hours. Codeshares and
alternate idents are NOT searched when matching against the ident key.

The supported operators include (note that operators take different numbers of arguments):

* false - results must have the specified boolean key set to a value of false. Example: {false arrived}

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli flights get-by-search`** - Search for airborne flights by matching against various parameters including
geospatial data. Uses a simplified query syntax compared to
/flights/search/advanced.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli flights get-count-by-search`** - Full search query documentation is available at the /flights/search
endpoint.

### foresight

Foresight endpoints provide access to FlightAware's Foresight predictive models and
predictions for key events. Our advanced machine learning (ML) models identify key
influencing factors for a flight to forecast future events in real-time, providing
unprecedented insight to improve operational efficiencies and facilitate better
decision-making in the air and on the ground. To learn more about the power of Foresight,
visit https://www.flightaware.com/commercial/foresight/

These endpoints each mirror a non-Foresight equivalent endpoint of similar functionality,
with the addition of all the ML 'predicted' values included in the Foresight response. The
respective non-Foresight endpoint response includes a flag, 'foresight_predictions_available',
which can optionally be used as a trigger to obtain and leverage Foresight predictions on an
as-needed basis and manage cost. Foresight is only available to Premium tier customers.
Contact integrationsales@flightaware.com for more information, pricing details, and to have
your account enabled for Foresight.

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli foresight get-flight-position-with`** - Get flight's current position, including Foresight data
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli foresight get-flight-with`** - Returns the flight info status summary for a registration, ident, or
fa_flight_id, including all available predicted fields.  If a
fa_flight_id is specified then a maximum of 1 flight is returned,
unless the flight has been diverted in which case both the original
flight and any diversions will be returned with a duplicate fa_flight_id.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli foresight get-flights-by-advanced-search-with`** - Returns currently or recently airborne flights based on geospatial
search parameters. If available, flights' predicted OOOI fields will be
set.

### history

Manage history

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli history get-aircraft-last-flight`** - Returns flight info status summary for an aircraft's last known flight
given its registration. The search is limited to flights flown since
January 1, 2011. On a successful response, the body will contain a
flights array with only 1 element. If a user queries a registration with
it's last known flight before January 1, 2011, an empty flights array will
be returned.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli history get-flight`** - Returns historical flight info status summary for a registration, ident,
or fa_flight_id. If a fa_flight_id is specified then a maximum of 1
flight is returned, unless the flight has been diverted in which case
both the original flight and any diversions will be returned with a
duplicate fa_flight_id. If a registraion or ident is specified then a
start_date and end_date must be specified. The span between start_date
and end_date can be up to 7 days. No more than 40 pages may be requested
at once. Data is available from now back to 2011-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

The field `inbound_fa_flight_id` will not be populated by this resource.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli history get-flight-map`** - Returns a historical flight's track as a base64-encoded image. Image can contain a
variety of additional data layers beyond just the track. Data is available from now back to
2011-01-01T00:00:00Z.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli history get-flight-route`** - Returns information about a historical flight's filed route including
coordinates, names, and types of fixes along the route.  Not all flight
routes can be successfully decoded by this endpoint, particularly if the
flight is not entirely within the continental U.S. airspace, since this function
only has access to navaids within that area. If data on a waypoint is
missing then the type will be listed as "UNKNOWN". Data is available from now back to
2011-01-01T00:00:00Z.
- **`flight-goat-pp-cli history get-flight-track`** - Returns the track for a historical flight as an array of positions.
Data is available from now back to 2011-01-01T00:00:00Z.

### operators

Manage operators

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli operators get`** - Returns information for an operator such as their name, ICAO/IATA

- **`flight-goat-pp-cli operators get-all`** - Returns list of operator references (ICAO/IATA codes and URLs to access
more information).

### schedules

one year into the future.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
flight-goat-pp-cli flights SEA LHR 2026-06-15

# JSON for scripting and agents
flight-goat-pp-cli flights SEA LHR 2026-06-15 --json

# Filter generated AeroAPI responses to specific fields
flight-goat-pp-cli airports get KSEA --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
flight-goat-pp-cli flights SEA LHR 2026-06-15 --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
flight-goat-pp-cli flights SEA LHR 2026-06-15 --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Retryable** - creates return "already exists" on retry, deletes return "already deleted"
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
flight-goat-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies CLI configuration, optional credentials, and connectivity to configured upstreams.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/flight-goat-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:
- `FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH`

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `flight-goat-pp-cli doctor` to check whether AeroAPI credentials are configured
- Verify the environment variable is present without printing it, e.g. `test -n "$FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH" && echo set || echo missing`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items
