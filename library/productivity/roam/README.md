# Roam CLI

**Every Roam HQ surface — chat, transcripts, On-Air events, SCIM, webhooks — in one local-first CLI with offline FTS search no other tool has.**

Roam HQ ships a remote MCP but no CLI. roam-pp-cli unifies all five Roam HQ APIs (HQ, On-Air, Chat, SCIM, Webhooks) into a single binary with a local SQLite cache and FTS5 search across messages and transcripts. Cron-friendly chat relay, decision extraction, attendance drift, and SCIM roster diff are built-in.

Created by [@gregvanhorn](https://github.com/gregvanhorn) (Greg Van Horn).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `roam-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-roam` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install roam
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install roam --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install roam --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install roam --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install roam --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/productivity/roam/cmd/roam-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/roam-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install roam --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-roam --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-roam --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install roam --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/roam-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `ROAM_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roam": {
      "command": "roam-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "ROAM_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Bearer auth via ROAM_API_KEY. Roam supports two key tiers: full-access organization keys and personal access tokens. Some HQ v1 endpoints require full-access; Chat/Transcript v0 endpoints work with PATs. Run `roam-pp-cli doctor token` to see which families your key can reach.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Verify which Roam APIs your key tier can reach before anything else.
roam-pp-cli doctor token

# Pull the last week of chat + transcripts into the local store for offline search.
roam-pp-cli sync --since 7d

# Cross-resource FTS5 search over messages and transcripts.
roam-pp-cli grep "pricing" --since 14d --json

# Extract decision-shaped lines from synced transcripts.
roam-pp-cli decisions --since 7d

# Pipe CI output to a Roam group with dedupe + Retry-After backoff.
echo "Deploy v1.2.3 succeeded" | roam-pp-cli relay --to eng-deploys --idempotent-key-prefix deploys

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`grep`** — Search across every chat message and meeting transcript at once with --since, --from-user, --in-meeting, --in-group filters.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs to recall what was said across many meetings without re-paging the rate-limited transcript API._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli grep "pricing" --since 14d --in-group eng --json --select transcript_id,line
  ```
- **`decisions`** — Surface decision-shaped lines ("we decided", "action item", "agreed", "let's go with") from synced transcripts.

  _Use when an agent owes the team a Monday recap; deterministic and citation-bearing._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli decisions --since 7d --in-group product --agent
  ```
- **`onair-attendance-drift`** — Compare invited guests vs actual attendance for an On-Air event; print invited-no-show and walk-in sets.

  _Use when an agent is asked who didn't show or who attended without an invite._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli onair-attendance-drift --event evt_123 --json
  ```
- **`webhook-tail`** — Tail recent webhook deliveries from the local subscription registry, --since filtered.

  _Use when debugging a webhook integration without standing up a listener._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli webhook-tail --since 1h --json
  ```
- **`mention-inbox`** — Local FTS over messages.text for @user tokens with --since filter; tail format.

  _Use when an agent must surface unread mentions across all groups without round-tripping the API per group._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli mention-inbox --user @me --since 7d --agent
  ```

### Mutation safety
- **`onair-reaper`** — Find recurring On-Air events with zero attendance over N days. --apply cancels them via the absorbed cancel endpoint.

  _Use when cleaning up dead recurring events; safe by default._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli onair-reaper --stale-days 60 --dry-run
  ```
- **`scim-diff`** — Diff a CSV/JSON HRIS roster against /Users SCIM list; print add/update/remove sets. --apply runs SCIM CRUD.

  _Use when an agent needs to reconcile an external roster with Roam membership without clicking through admin UI._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli scim-diff --roster hris.csv --apply --dry-run
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`transcript-fanout`** — Run a single question against every transcript in a date range; one row per transcript with answer + citation.

  _Use when an agent must scan many meetings for a single question without re-prompting each one._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli transcript-fanout --question "did anyone mention Q3 hiring?" --since 30d --agent
  ```
- **`relay`** — Pipe arbitrary stdin lines into a Roam group via /chat.post with deterministic idempotency keys and 429 backoff.

  _Use when an agent needs to forward a stream (CI, alerts, logs) into Roam without writing a custom webhook._

  ```bash
  tail -F deploys.log | roam-pp-cli relay --to eng-deploys --idempotent-key-prefix deploys
  ```

### Reachability mitigation
- **`doctor token`** — Probe one representative GET per spec family (HQ, On-Air, Chat, SCIM, Webhooks) and print which families this key can reach.

  _Use when an agent needs to know which Roam commands will work with the credential it has before attempting them._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli doctor token
  ```

The ordering of results depends on the filter specified:

- When no parameters are provided, the most recent recordings are returned,
  sorted in reverse chronological order. This is equivalent to specifying `before`
  as NOW and leaving `after` unspecified.

- If `after` is specified, the results are sorted in forward chronological order.

Either dates or datetimes may be specified. Dates are interpreted in UTC.

Messages may be posted to a chat, a group, or one or more addresses (e.g. users, bots).

Mentions are supported with the syntax `<@USER_ID>`, e.g. `<!@U-7861a4c6-765a-495d-898d-fae3d8fbba2d>` or `<@all>` to notify everyone in the chat.
When rendered in the client, the tag will automatically be replaced with the human-readable display name (or "everyone" for `<@all>`).

**Access:** Organization and Personal. In Organization mode, messages are sent with the app's bot persona. In Personal mode, messages are sent as the authenticated user.

**Required scope:** `chat:send_message` or `chat:write`

---

**OpenAPI Spec:** [chat.json](https://developer.ro.am/chat.json)

### chat-send-message

Manage chat send message

- **`roam-pp-cli chat-send-message send-message`** - Sends the given message to the specified recipients. At this time, we only
support sending to a single group recipient. You can obtain the group ID on the "Group
Settings" page. That means `recipients` will always be a single-element array containing
a single UUIDv4.

The `sender` JSON object contains three (optional) string fields: `id`, `name`, and
`imageUrl`. The `id` is an internal name of the bot you wish to send as, `name` is the
user-visible bot name (that is seen when viewing groups), and `imageUrl` is the image
URL of the bot. Generally, you only need to specify `id` and `name` (e.g.
`datadog` as `id` and `Datadog Alerts` as `name`). If omitted, the ID and
sender are inferred to be the API client name.

## Message Text Format

At this time, we do not fully support standard Markdown, but support is forthcoming. To
indicate a line break, you must use TWO new line characters in the message (e.g.. `\n\n`).

chats within your account.

For customers with archival enabled (please reach out to a Roam
ArchiTech to get this process started), at the end of every day,
we export all message events for a particular day as a JSON Lines file.
This file contains all messages sent:
- by a Roam user who is a member of your organization
- into a chat containing (at the time of export) at least one Roam user who is a member of your organization
- by a bot integration that is part of your organization

**Required fields:** `userName`, `name.givenName`, `name.familyName`, and `emails[0].value`.

**Roam-specific behavior:**
- `userName` must exactly match the primary email address

- Email/userName becomes **immutable** after creation
- Use the `urn:ro.am:params:scim:schemas:extension:roam:2.0:User` extension to set `role` ("User" or "Admin")

See [RFC 7644 §3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.3) for SCIM resource creation.
- **`roam-pp-cli users 01-delete`** - Archives a user in Roam. This is a **soft delete** — the user's data is retained but they lose access.

**Roam-specific behavior:**
- The user is marked as archived (equivalent to `active: false`)
- Archived users can be reactivated via PUT or PATCH with `active: true`
- To permanently delete user data, contact Roam support

See [RFC 7644 §3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.6) for SCIM resource deletion.

See [RFC 7644 §3.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.4.2) for SCIM filtering and pagination.
- **`roam-pp-cli users 01-patch`** - Partially updates a user. Roam supports SCIM PATCH for Users with **limited semantics**.

**Supported operations:**
- `replace` of `active` only (to archive or reactivate a user)

**Not supported:**
- `add` / `remove` operations
- `replace` for any other attribute

To update other fields like name, use PUT (Replace User) instead.

See [RFC 7644 §3.5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.5.2) for SCIM PATCH operations.
- **`roam-pp-cli users 01-replace`** - Fully replaces a user's attributes. You must provide all required fields in the request body.

**Roam-specific behavior:**
- `userName` and `emails` are **immutable** — any attempt to change them returns a 400 error
- You can update `name.givenName`, `name.familyName`, `active`, `externalId`, and `role`
- Set `active: false` to archive the user; `active: true` to reactivate

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
roam-pp-cli addr-info

# JSON for scripting and agents
roam-pp-cli addr-info --json

# Filter to specific fields
roam-pp-cli addr-info --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
roam-pp-cli addr-info --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
roam-pp-cli addr-info --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
roam-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/roam-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ROAM_API_KEY` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `roam-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $ROAM_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **403 "This endpoint requires full access. Personal access tokens are not supported."** — Run `roam-pp-cli doctor token` to see which spec families your token covers; use an organization-level key for HQ v1 endpoints.
- **429 with Retry-After** — The adaptive limiter honors Retry-After automatically. Reduce concurrent batches or use --idempotent-key-prefix for safe retries.
- **Empty grep results after sync** — Run `roam-pp-cli sync --full transcripts messages` — incremental sync may not have populated yet.
