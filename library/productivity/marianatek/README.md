# Mariana Tek CLI

**Every Mariana Tek booking feature, plus multi-tenant search, cancellation watching, and an offline class catalog no other tool has.**

marianatek is the first CLI and MCP server for the Mariana Tek booking platform that powers hundreds of boutique-fitness, yoga, sauna, and wellness studios. Beyond mirroring every Customer API endpoint, it adds a local SQLite catalog, FTS5 search across class sessions, cancellation watching (the API exposes no waitlist signal), and joins across tenants that the per-studio iframe widget can't perform.

Created by [@salmonumbrella](https://github.com/salmonumbrella) (salmonumbrella).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `marianatek-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-marianatek` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install marianatek
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install marianatek --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install marianatek --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install marianatek --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install marianatek --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/productivity/marianatek/cmd/marianatek-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/marianatek-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install marianatek --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-marianatek --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-marianatek --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install marianatek --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/marianatek-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `CUSTOMER_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marianatek": {
      "command": "marianatek-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "CUSTOMER_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Each tenant is its own brand subdomain ({tenant}.marianatek.com), so authentication is per-tenant. Run `marianatek login --tenant kolmkontrast` to launch the OAuth2 Authorization Code flow in your browser; the refresh token lands at `~/.config/marianatek/<tenant>.token.json` (0600). The HTTP client transparently refreshes on 401. For headless / CI use, `marianatek login --tenant <slug> --email --password` performs an OAuth2 password grant. Logout with `marianatek logout --tenant <slug>` deletes the token file.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Open the OAuth flow in your browser; refresh token is saved to disk so subsequent commands run without prompts.
marianatek login --tenant kolmkontrast

# Cache the next two weeks of class sessions + your reservations into the local store. This populates every transcendence command.
marianatek sync --tenant kolmkontrast --window 14d

# Find candidate classes via FTS5 over the synced catalog. --agent emits structured JSON ready for an LLM to read.
marianatek search "vinyasa morning" --agent

# Poll a sold-out class and book the spot the instant it opens. NDJSON output streams events as they happen.
marianatek watch 84212 --interval 60s --auto-book --agent

# Surface credit packs about to lapse so you don't waste them. Suitable as a weekly cron.
marianatek expiring --within 720h --agent

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cancellation hunting
- **`watch`** — Poll a sold-out class (or a filter) and emit a structured event the moment a spot opens — optionally auto-book in the same tick.

  _Reach for this whenever the user wants a sold-out class. NDJSON output lets the agent decide what to do on cancellation events._

  ```bash
  marianatek watch 84212 --interval 60s --auto-book --agent
  ```
- **`book-regular`** — Resolve a natural slot key ('tue-7am-vinyasa') against the regulars table, find the next matching upcoming class, and book it.

  _The agent shorthand for repeat-booking workflows. Pair with regulars to discover the slot keys this user has._

  ```bash
  marianatek book-regular --slot "tue-7am-vinyasa" --auto --agent
  ```

### Multi-tenant power
- **`schedule`** — Query the merged class catalog across every tenant you have logged into, with structured filters that the per-tenant iframe widget cannot offer.

  _When a user belongs to multiple studios, this is the only way to see all options at once. Always pair with --select to keep the response narrow._

  ```bash
  marianatek schedule --any-tenant --type vinyasa --before 07:00 --window 7d --agent --select tenant,location,start_time,instructor
  ```
- **`conflicts`** — Read reservations across all logged-in tenants, optionally pull an exported ICS calendar, and flag overlapping intervals or insufficient buffer.

  _Critical for multi-tenant users with packed calendars. Use --buffer to enforce minimum gap between back-to-back sessions._

  ```bash
  marianatek conflicts 2026-05-15 --ics ~/Downloads/calendar.ics --buffer 30m --agent
  ```
- **`search`** — Full-text search across cached class sessions, instructors, locations, and class types — ranks by BM25 and respects --any-tenant.

  _Use when the user's request is fuzzy. Always emit --select-narrowed output so you can fit several results in context._

  ```bash
  marianatek search "vinyasa soho morning" --agent --select tenant,start_time,instructor,location,spots_left
  ```

### Personal insights
- **`regulars`** — Group your local reservation history by instructor, class type, time-of-day, day-of-week, or location and rank the dimensions you actually use.

  _Use this to ground recommendations in what the user actually does, rather than what the API thinks they like._

  ```bash
  marianatek regulars --by instructor --top 5 --agent
  ```
- **`expiring`** — Surface credit packs and memberships about to lapse, with remaining balance and the classes that would consume them best.

  _Pre-empt wasted credits. Run as a weekly cron; if non-empty, the user has action to take._

  ```bash
  marianatek expiring --within 720h --agent
  ```

### Operations
- **`doctor`** — Per-tenant token expiry, last-sync timestamp, row counts, and a live class-probe for reachability.

  _Run before any cron job or watch session. If any tenant is in 'expired' state, refresh tokens before scheduling._

  ```bash
  marianatek doctor --agent
  ```

marianatek-pp-cli app-version-metadatas list

# JSON for scripting and agents
marianatek-pp-cli app-version-metadatas list --json

# Filter to specific fields
marianatek-pp-cli app-version-metadatas list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
marianatek-pp-cli app-version-metadatas list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
marianatek-pp-cli app-version-metadatas list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
marianatek-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/customer-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CUSTOMER_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `marianatek-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $CUSTOMER_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 Unauthorized from any /me endpoint** — Refresh tokens expired. Run `marianatek login --tenant <slug>` again, or check `marianatek doctor` to see which tenant is expired.
- **watch never fires even though a spot opened in the browser** — Increase polling frequency with `--interval 30s` and confirm the class id is in the local cache: `marianatek classes get <id>`.
- **schedule returns empty under --any-tenant** — Sync hasn't run for one or more tenants. Run `marianatek sync` per tenant, or `marianatek sync --all-tenants`.
- **book / book-regular returns 402 payment required** — No applicable credit, membership, or default credit card. Run `marianatek classes payment-options <id>` to see what payment paths exist, then `marianatek cards list` to confirm a default card is on file.
