# Resend CLI

**The full Resend API (100 endpoints across emails, broadcasts, audiences, contacts, domains, templates, webhooks) plus a local SQLite cache that powers cross-resource queries the dashboard and SDK cannot answer.**

The official Resend CLI is fast and one-shot per command; this CLI is the agent-native companion with --json --select --dry-run consistency, FTS5 search over sent emails, and rollups (audiences inventory, broadcasts performance, deliverability summary, contacts where, emails to <recipient>) that exist only because every Resend resource is mirrored locally.

Created by [@giacaglia](https://github.com/giacaglia) (Giuliano Giacaglia).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `resend-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-resend` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install resend
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install resend --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install resend --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install resend --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install resend --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/productivity/resend/cmd/resend-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/resend-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install resend --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-resend --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-resend --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install resend --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/resend-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `RESEND_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "resend": {
      "command": "resend-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "RESEND_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Verify RESEND_API_KEY and reach api.resend.com.
resend-pp-cli doctor

# Populate the local SQLite store with audiences, contacts, domains, broadcasts, and templates.
resend-pp-cli sync --full

# First read — confirm sync landed.
resend-pp-cli domains list --json --select id,name,status

# Cross-audience rollup the official CLI cannot produce.
resend-pp-cli audiences inventory --json

# FTS across emails, contacts, broadcasts, and templates.
resend-pp-cli search invoice --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-resource queries over local state
- **`emails to`** — Every email sent to a single recipient address, with delivery status and timestamps, ordered newest-first.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs to reconstruct what a single user has received — support tickets, GDPR exports, dispute investigations._

  ```bash
  resend-pp-cli emails to <your-email> --json --select id,subject,status,sent_at
  ```
- **`emails timeline`** — Collapsed event chain for a single email: sent → delivered → opened → clicked → bounced, in one ordered table.

  _Use when debugging 'why didn't this arrive?' — one command shows whether it was sent, delivered, opened, or bounced and when._

  ```bash
  resend-pp-cli emails timeline 4ef9a417-d4ff-4ec5-9af2-c80a4d5d2c1f --json
  ```
- **`audiences inventory`** — Per-audience rollup: contact count, unsubscribed count, last-broadcast timestamp, recent open-rate.

  _Use before planning a campaign — quickly see which audiences are healthy and recently engaged._

  ```bash
  resend-pp-cli audiences inventory --json
  ```
- **`contacts where`** — Find every audience, segment, and topic a contact (by email or name) belongs to in one query.

  _Use when triaging unsubscribe requests, GDPR deletions, or 'why is bob getting this email?'._

  ```bash
  resend-pp-cli contacts where <contact-email> --json --select audience_name,subscribed
  ```

### Aggregate analytics from local store
- **`broadcasts performance`** — Open / click / bounce rate across all broadcasts, sortable; not limited to a single broadcast or 30-day window.

  _Use to compare campaign performance across the lifetime of the account._

  ```bash
  resend-pp-cli broadcasts performance --json --select broadcasts,count,status
  ```
- **`domains health`** — Verification + DKIM/SPF/DMARC status across every domain in one table, flags missing or unverified records.

  _Use on call-out / deliverability incidents to confirm all sending domains are fully verified._

  ```bash
  resend-pp-cli domains health --json
  ```
- **`deliverability summary`** — Bounce rate, complaint rate, and suppression count over a rolling window (default 7d) computed from local event data.

  _Use weekly to monitor IP/domain reputation trends before they cause deliverability incidents._

  ```bash
  resend-pp-cli deliverability summary --window 7d --json
  ```

### Operational hygiene
- **`api-keys rotation`** — API keys sorted by age + last-used timestamp (joined from logs); flags stale keys older than N days.

  _Use during quarterly security reviews — find unused keys that should be rotated or revoked._

  ```bash
  resend-pp-cli api-keys rotation --older-than 90d --json
  ```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
resend-pp-cli api-keys list

# JSON for scripting and agents
resend-pp-cli api-keys list --json

# Filter to specific fields
resend-pp-cli api-keys list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
resend-pp-cli api-keys list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
resend-pp-cli api-keys list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
resend-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/resend-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `resend-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $RESEND_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 unauthorized on every command** — Confirm RESEND_API_KEY is exported. Keys start with re_… and are visible at resend.com/api-keys.
- **Local commands return zero rows** — Run `resend-pp-cli sync --full` — local-only commands read from the SQLite cache.
- **429 rate limit** — Resend documents Retry-After. Lower --rate-limit (default 0 = unbounded) or run sync in off-hours.
- **Domain reports unverified after creation** — Resend caches DNS for ~24h; `domains verify <id>` triggers re-check, and `domains get <id>` shows current DKIM/SPF/DMARC state.
