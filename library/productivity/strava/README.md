# Strava CLI

**Every Strava feature, plus offline analytics — training load, power curves, zone time, and segment progression — that the website can't show you.**

strava-pp-cli syncs your entire Strava history to a local SQLite database, then unlocks the analytics your training actually requires: CTL/ATL training load, power curve, zone time distribution, aerobic decoupling, and segment effort progression. Everything works offline, composes with jq, and speaks JSON natively for AI coaching agents.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `strava-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-strava` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install strava
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install strava --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install strava --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install strava --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install strava --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/productivity/strava/cmd/strava-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/strava-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install strava --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-strava --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-strava --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install strava --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/strava-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `STRAVA_STRAVA_OAUTH` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "strava": {
      "command": "strava-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "STRAVA_STRAVA_OAUTH": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Strava uses OAuth2. Run `strava-pp-cli auth login` to open the browser authorization page — the CLI handles the local callback, token exchange, and storage automatically. Set STRAVA_CLIENT_ID and STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET before running. Tokens are refreshed automatically; run `auth refresh` to force a refresh.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Verify credentials and API connectivity (run auth login first if not authenticated)
strava-pp-cli doctor

# Verify credentials and check API connectivity
strava-pp-cli doctor

# Mirror your Strava data to a local SQLite database
strava-pp-cli sync

# See your CTL/ATL/TSB training load timeline
strava-pp-cli training load --weeks 12

# Compute your power curve from synced stream data
strava-pp-cli athlete power-curve --since 2025-01-01

# Track your progression on a specific segment over time
strava-pp-cli segments progress 229781

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`segments progress`** — See your entire effort history on a segment — date, time, avg power, avg HR, delta from PR — so you can track if you're actually improving.

  _Use this when an agent needs to assess whether an athlete is progressing on a target training segment over a season._

  ```bash
  strava-pp-cli segments progress 229781 --json --select start_date,elapsed,avg_watts,delta_pr_seconds
  ```
- **`training load`** — See your Chronic Training Load, Acute Training Load, and Training Stress Balance as sparklines so you can spot overtraining or undertaper before a race.

  _Use when an agent needs to assess an athlete's fitness/fatigue state and readiness for an upcoming event._

  ```bash
  strava-pp-cli training load --weeks 12 --ftp 285 --agent
  ```
- **`training zones`** — See how many minutes per week you actually spent in each heart rate or power zone, so you can tell if your training distribution matches your plan.

  _Use when evaluating whether a training block was executed as prescribed (polarized, sweet-spot, base)._

  ```bash
  strava-pp-cli training zones --weeks 8 --type Run --zone-type heartrate --agent
  ```
- **`athlete power-curve`** — See your best mean power for every standard duration (1s to 60min) so you can identify strengths, weaknesses, and fitness changes across seasons.

  _Use when an agent needs to characterize a cyclist's physiological profile or compare peak power across training blocks._

  ```bash
  strava-pp-cli athlete power-curve --since 2025-01-01 --weight 75 --agent
  ```
- **`activities drift`** — Measure aerobic decoupling in an activity — the ratio of HR rise to pace drop in the second half — to assess aerobic fitness without lab testing.

  _Use when an agent needs to identify which long runs or rides showed aerobic decoupling, indicating the athlete was above their aerobic threshold._

  ```bash
  strava-pp-cli activities drift --min-duration 45m --since 2025-01-01 --threshold 5 --agent
  ```
- **`segments kom-gap`** — See exactly how far you are from the KOM on each starred segment, ranked by the gap you're most likely to close.

  _Use when an agent needs to surface the most achievable KOM targets for a training plan or pre-ride goal setting._

  ```bash
  strava-pp-cli segments kom-gap --top 10 --agent
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`activities bulk-update`** — Update gear, name template, or description across hundreds of activities at once with a preview-before-commit safety net.

  _Use when an agent needs to mass-migrate a gear assignment after equipment replacement or retroactively organize a training block's activities._

  ```bash
  strava-pp-cli activities bulk-update --type Ride --after 2024-01-01 --set-gear b12345678 --dry-run
  ```
- **`gear status`** — See total mileage on each shoe and bike, your configured replacement threshold, and an estimated retirement date based on your recent usage rate.

  _Use when an agent needs to check whether any gear is approaching retirement before an important race._

  ```bash
  strava-pp-cli gear status --threshold shoes=500mi --agent
  ```

strava-pp-cli activities create-activity --name example-resource --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
strava-pp-cli activities create-activity --name example-resource --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
strava-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/strava-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `STRAVA_STRAVA_OAUTH` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `strava-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $STRAVA_STRAVA_OAUTH`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **auth login fails with redirect_uri mismatch** — Set STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI to the value configured in your Strava API application settings (default: http://localhost:8421/callback)
- **HTTP 429 during sync** — Strava rate-limits at 200 requests/15min. Run sync --slow to add a 1s delay between requests, or wait for the 15-minute window to reset
- **power-curve returns no data** — Power data requires sync with --streams flag: run sync --streams to fetch per-second watts data. Requires activities recorded with a power meter
- **training load shows 0 TSS** — TSS computation uses Strava's suffer_score by default. For power-based TSS supply --ftp <watts> and run sync --streams first
- **bulk-update hits rate limit mid-run** — Re-run with --rate-limit-sleep 4 to spread requests across the 15-min window. The command is idempotent — already-updated activities are skipped
