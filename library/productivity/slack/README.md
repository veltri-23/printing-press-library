# Slack CLI

Send messages, search conversations, monitor channels, and manage your Slack workspace from the terminal

Created by [@mvanhorn](https://github.com/mvanhorn) (Matt Van Horn).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `slack-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-slack` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install slack
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install slack --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install slack --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install slack --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install slack --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/productivity/slack/cmd/slack-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/slack-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install slack --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-slack --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-slack --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install slack --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Authenticate
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-your-token-here"

# 2. Verify setup
slack-pp-cli doctor

# 3. Sync workspace data locally for search and analytics
slack-pp-cli sync

# 4. Get a daily digest of activity across channels
slack-pp-cli digest

# 5. Search messages across the workspace
slack-pp-cli search "project launch"
```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

- **`health`** - See which channels are thriving and which are dying with messages/day, response times, and active poster counts
- **`response-times`** - Measure how fast your team responds to messages and threads in any channel
- **`digest`** - Get a daily or weekly summary of activity, mentions, and action items across all channels
- **`threads-stale`** - Find unanswered threads that need attention before they go cold
- **`trends`** - Track channel activity over time to spot patterns and shifts
- **`quiet`** - Find channels with no recent activity that may be candidates for archiving
- **`activity`** - See where a team member is active across channels, threads, and reactions

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
slack-pp-cli users

# JSON for scripting and agents
slack-pp-cli users --json

# Filter to specific fields
slack-pp-cli users --json --select id,name,real_name

# CSV for spreadsheets
slack-pp-cli users --csv

# Dry run - show the request without sending
slack-pp-cli conversations history --channel C0123456789 --dry-run

# Agent mode - JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
slack-pp-cli users --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Retryable** - creates return "already exists" on retry, deletes return "already deleted"
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - `echo '{"key":"value"}' | slack-pp-cli messages post_message --stdin`
- **Cacheable** - GET responses cached for 5 minutes, bypass with `--no-cache`
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set
- **Progress events** - paginated commands emit NDJSON events to stderr in default mode

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use as MCP Server

This CLI ships a companion MCP server for use with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add slack slack-pp-mcp -e SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slack": {
      "command": "slack-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Look up a user by email
slack-pp-cli users lookup_by_email --email alice@example.com --json
```

## Health Check

```bash
slack-pp-cli doctor
```

```
  OK Config: ok
  OK Auth: configured
  OK API: reachable
  config_path: ~/.config/slack-pp-cli/config.json
  base_url: https://slack.com/api
```

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/slack-pp-cli/config.json`

Environment variables:
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - Slack Bot User OAuth Token (starts with `xoxb-`). Get one at https://api.slack.com/apps
- `SLACK_USER_TOKEN` - Slack User OAuth Token (starts with `xoxp-`). Get one at https://api.slack.com/apps
- `SLACK_BASE_URL` - Override the API base URL (default: `https://slack.com/api`). Useful for testing or proxies
- `SLACK_CONFIG` - Override config file path

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `slack-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
- Ensure the token has the required scopes for the operation

**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct (channel IDs start with `C`, user IDs with `U`)
- Run `slack-pp-cli conversations` or `slack-pp-cli users` to list available items

**Rate limit errors (exit code 7)**
- The CLI auto-retries with exponential backoff
- Use `--rate-limit 1` to limit requests per second
- If persistent, wait a few minutes and try again

**Empty analytics results**
- Run `slack-pp-cli sync` first to populate local data
- Use `--days` to adjust the time window

## Agent workflow features

This CLI was patched to add these agent-workflow capabilities (see [`printing-press patch`](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/pull/221)):

- **Named profiles** — save a set of flags under a name and reuse them: `slack-pp-cli profile save <name> --<flag> <value>`, then `slack-pp-cli --profile <name> <command>`. Flag precedence: explicit flag > env var > profile > default.
- **`--deliver`** — route command output to a sink other than stdout. Values: `file:<path>` writes atomically via tmp+rename; `webhook:<url>` POSTs as JSON (or NDJSON with `--compact`).
- **`feedback`** — record in-band feedback about the CLI. Entries append as JSON lines to `~/.slack-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. When `SLACK_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set and either `--send` is passed or `SLACK_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`, the entry is also POSTed upstream.
