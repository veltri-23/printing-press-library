# Weather GOAT CLI

The weather CLI that answers the questions you actually ask: Should I bike today? Do I need an umbrella for the walk home? Is there a tornado warning? Is this summer hotter than normal?

Powered by Open-Meteo (global forecasts, 80 years of history, air quality) and NWS (severe weather alerts). No API key required.

Created by [@tmchow](https://github.com/tmchow) (Trevin Chow).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `weather-goat-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-weather-goat` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install weather-goat
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install weather-goat --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install weather-goat --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install weather-goat --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install weather-goat --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/weather-goat/cmd/weather-goat-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/weather-goat-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install weather-goat --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-weather-goat --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-weather-goat --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install weather-goat --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Authentication

Open-Meteo is a free API — no API key required. NWS alerts also require no authentication.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set your default location
weather-goat-pp-cli config set-location "Seattle"

# 2. Check your setup
weather-goat-pp-cli doctor

# 3. Get a full weather brief (current conditions + forecast + alerts)
weather-goat-pp-cli

# 4. Should I bike today?
weather-goat-pp-cli go bike

# 5. Check air quality before going outside
weather-goat-pp-cli breathe
```

## What Makes This Different

Every weather CLI shows you temperature and precipitation. Weather Goat answers the questions that actually drive decisions.

**"Should I bike today?"** — `go bike` checks wind, rain, temperature, ice, and air quality. Returns GO, CAUTION, or STOP with specific reasons.

**"Do I need an umbrella for the walk home?"** — `go commute` checks the forecast at your departure AND return times. "Clear this morning, rain by 5pm — take an umbrella."

**"Is there a severe weather warning?"** — `alerts` pulls active NWS warnings (tornado, storm, flood, heat). `watch` polls every 60 seconds during active weather.

**"Is this summer actually hotter than normal?"** — `normal` compares today to the historical average for this date. "Today is 8°F above average for April 11."

**"Beach or mountains this weekend?"** — `compare "Malibu" "Big Bear"` shows side-by-side forecasts.

**"Is the air quality safe to run in?"** — `breathe` shows AQI, pollen, UV, and whether it's safe to exercise outdoors.

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** — `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Confirmable** — `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Cacheable** — GET responses cached for 5 minutes, bypass with `--no-cache`
- **Agent-safe by default** — no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set
- **Progress events** — paginated commands emit NDJSON events to stderr

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use as MCP Server

This CLI ships a companion MCP server for use with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add weather weather-goat-pp-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "weather-goat-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

```

```
  OK Config: ok
  WARN Auth: not required
  OK API: reachable
  config_path: ~/.config/weather-goat-pp-cli/config.toml
  base_url: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1
```

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/weather-goat-pp-cli/config.toml`

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `WEATHER_CONFIG` | Override config file path |
| `WEATHER_BASE_URL` | Override API base URL (for self-hosted Open-Meteo) |

Config file fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `base_url` | API base URL (default: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1`) |
| `latitude` | Default latitude for location-based commands |
| `longitude` | Default longitude for location-based commands |
| `location_name` | Display name for the saved location |

| `commute_return_time` | Return time for commute forecast (e.g., `18:00`) |

## Self-Hosting

If you run a self-hosted Open-Meteo instance:

```bash
export WEATHER_BASE_URL=https://your-open-meteo-instance.example.com/v1
```

Or set `base_url` in your config file.

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Open-Meteo is free and doesn't require authentication
- Run `weather-goat-pp-cli doctor` to check connectivity

**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the location name or coordinates are correct
- Try `weather-goat-pp-cli geocoding "city name"` to verify coordinates

**Rate limit errors (exit code 7)**
- The CLI auto-retries with exponential backoff
- Open-Meteo allows 10,000 requests/day on the free tier
- If persistent, wait a few minutes or use `--rate-limit 1`

**No location configured**
- Run `weather-goat-pp-cli config set-location "City Name"` to save a default
- Or pass a location inline: `weather-goat-pp-cli go walk "Denver"`

## Sources & Inspiration

This CLI was built by studying these projects and resources:

- [**wttr.in**](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in) — Python
- [**open-meteo-mcp**](https://github.com/cmer81/open-meteo-mcp) — TypeScript
- [**wthrr**](https://github.com/ttytm/wthrr-the-weathercrab) — Rust

<!-- pr-218-features -->
## Agent workflow features

This CLI was patched to add these agent-workflow capabilities (see [`printing-press patch`](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/pull/221)):

- **Named profiles** — save a set of flags under a name and reuse them: `weather-goat-pp-cli profile save <name> --<flag> <value>`, then `weather-goat-pp-cli --profile <name> <command>`. Flag precedence: explicit flag > env var > profile > default.
- **`--deliver`** — route command output to a sink other than stdout. Values: `file:<path>` writes atomically via tmp+rename; `webhook:<url>` POSTs as JSON (or NDJSON with `--compact`).
- **`feedback`** — record in-band feedback about the CLI. Entries append as JSON lines to `~/.weather-goat-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. When `WEATHER_GOAT_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set and either `--send` is passed or `WEATHER_GOAT_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`, the entry is also POSTed upstream.
