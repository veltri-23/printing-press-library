# Open-Meteo CLI

**Every Open-Meteo endpoint family in one CLI — forecast, archive, marine, air quality, flood, climate, ensemble, seasonal, geocoding, elevation.**

Comprehensive coverage of Open-Meteo's free, no-API-key tier across all 11 endpoint families. City-name input via integrated geocoding, WMO code humanization, and a local SQLite cache that powers commands no upstream tool can: forecast diff, climate-vs-now compare, activity verdicts, climate normals.

Created by [@tmchow](https://github.com/tmchow) (Trevin Chow).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `open-meteo-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-open-meteo` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install open-meteo
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install open-meteo --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install open-meteo --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install open-meteo --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install open-meteo --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/open-meteo/cmd/open-meteo-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/open-meteo-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install open-meteo --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-open-meteo --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-open-meteo --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install open-meteo --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/open-meteo-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/open-meteo/cmd/open-meteo-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-meteo": {
      "command": "open-meteo-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

No API key required. The free tier supports up to ~10,000 requests per day for non-commercial use. If you have an Open-Meteo customer-tier subscription, set OPEN_METEO_API_KEY in the environment and the CLI auto-routes to customer-*.open-meteo.com with the apikey appended — same commands, same flags, higher limits, commercial use allowed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Resolve a place name to coordinates (used by spec-derived commands).
# Novel commands (panel, compare, normals, weather-mix, forecast diff,
# accuracy, is-good-for) accept --place natively.
open-meteo-pp-cli geocode search --name Seattle --count 1 --json

# Current conditions for a city by name (panel takes --place natively).
open-meteo-pp-cli panel --place Seattle --current temperature_2m,weather_code --humanize

# 7-day daily forecast as JSON.
open-meteo-pp-cli forecast --latitude 47.6062 --longitude -122.3321 --daily temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,precipitation_sum --forecast-days 7 --json

# Historical ERA5 data — works for any date back to 1940.
open-meteo-pp-cli archive --latitude 47.6062 --longitude -122.3321 --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-01-31 --daily temperature_2m_max --json

# Climate-vs-now anomaly: how today compares to the 30-year normal (--place native).
open-meteo-pp-cli compare --place Seattle --metric temperature_2m_mean --years 30 --json

# Side-by-side multi-location panel in one batched call.
open-meteo-pp-cli panel --place Seattle,Berlin,Tokyo --current temperature_2m,weather_code --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`forecast diff`** — See exactly what changed since the last forecast pull for this location — temperature deltas, new precipitation hours, weather-code shifts.

  _Pick this when an agent needs to react to forecast changes (alerting, replanning) rather than to the current forecast itself._

  ```bash
  open-meteo-pp-cli forecast diff --place Seattle --json --select changes
  ```
- **`normals`** — Compute the 30-year (or user-specified) climate normal for any (location, day-of-year, variable) tuple.

  _Use to ground a 'normal vs current' answer. Also useful for travel/timing recommendations across decades._

  ```bash
  open-meteo-pp-cli normals --place Seattle --month 7 --variable temperature_2m_max --years 30 --json
  ```
- **`accuracy`** — For any past date, compare what the model predicted (cached snapshot) against what actually happened (archive ground truth).

  _Use to score forecast trust over time, or to debug a 'why did the forecast change?' question._

  ```bash
  open-meteo-pp-cli accuracy --place Seattle --date 2025-12-25 --variable temperature_2m_max --json
  ```
- **`weather-mix`** — Distribution of WMO weather conditions (% clear, % rain, % storms, etc.) over an arbitrary historical window for a place.

  _Use for travel planning, climatology summaries, or 'how often does it rain in November?' questions._

  ```bash
  open-meteo-pp-cli weather-mix --place Seattle --past-days 30 --json
  ```

### Cross-API joins
- **`compare`** — Compare today's weather (or any forecast hour) against the 30-year climate normal for that date and place.

  _Use when a user asks 'is this weather unusual?' or 'how does this compare to historical?' — a single API call cannot answer._

  ```bash
  open-meteo-pp-cli compare --place Seattle --metric temperature_2m_mean --years 30 --json
  ```
- **`is-good-for`** — Verdict (GO / CAUTION / STOP) for surfing, skiing, hiking, running, biking based on combined forecast + marine + air-quality thresholds.

  _Use when the user asks a decision question, not a data question. Saves the agent from synthesizing 3 endpoint calls into a verdict._

  ```bash
  open-meteo-pp-cli is-good-for surfing --place "Half Moon Bay, CA" --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`panel`** — One-command snapshot panel for N locations side-by-side — batched in a single Open-Meteo call when possible.

  _Use to compare conditions across locations in one shot; cheaper and faster than N separate calls._

  ```bash
  open-meteo-pp-cli panel --place Seattle,Berlin,Tokyo --current temperature_2m,wind_speed_10m,weather_code --json
  ```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
open-meteo-pp-cli air-quality

# JSON for scripting and agents
open-meteo-pp-cli air-quality --json

# Filter to specific fields
open-meteo-pp-cli air-quality --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
open-meteo-pp-cli air-quality --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
open-meteo-pp-cli air-quality --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Freshness

This CLI owns bounded freshness for registered store-backed read command paths. In `--data-source auto` mode, covered commands check the local SQLite store before serving results; stale or missing resources trigger a bounded refresh, and refresh failures fall back to the existing local data with a warning. `--data-source local` never refreshes, and `--data-source live` reads the API without mutating the local store.

Set `OPEN_METEO_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` to disable the pre-read freshness hook while preserving the selected data source.

JSON outputs that use the generated provenance envelope include freshness metadata at `meta.freshness`. This metadata describes the freshness decision for the covered command path; it does not claim full historical backfill or API-specific enrichment.

## Health Check

```bash
open-meteo-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/open-meteo-pp-cli/config.toml`

## Troubleshooting
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **429 "Daily API request limit exceeded"** — Free tier caps ~10k/day, 5k/hr, 600/min. Wait, or set OPEN_METEO_API_KEY for the customer tier.
- **"reason":"Cannot initialize a Float from invalid Float value 'nan'"** — Some variables are missing for some hours (e.g., night-time UV). Drop the variable or filter: --select hourly.time,hourly.temperature_2m
- **Place name returns wrong location** — Disambiguate with comma-separated context: --place "Springfield, IL, US". Or look up by ID: open-meteo-pp-cli geocode search Springfield --count 10
- **Hourly arrays look misaligned** — All hourly/daily arrays index-align with .time. Use --select hourly.time,hourly.temperature_2m to keep them paired in agent output.
