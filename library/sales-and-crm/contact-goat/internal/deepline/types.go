// Package deepline provides a hybrid Deepline API client that prefers the
// official `deepline` subprocess when present and falls back to direct HTTP.
// Deepline is a credit-priced contact-data API (https://code.deepline.com/);
// every execute call costs credits, so the client exposes a cost estimator
// and a local execution log for budget awareness.

// Known tool IDs referenced by the typed subcommands. The API is tool-based:
// every call is POST /integrations/{toolId}/execute with a tool-specific
// JSON payload.
//
// Tool IDs verified against `deepline tools list` on 2026-04-20. The previous
// revision of this file pointed ToolPersonEnrich at ai_ark_personality_analysis
// and ToolEmailFind at ai_ark_find_emails; neither is a direct email
// enrichment tool. Personality analysis returns personality traits (not
// contact info) and requires a `url` payload field; ai_ark_find_emails is an
// async follow-on to ai_ark_people_search that requires a trackId. Those
// constants are preserved here under clearer names for callers that genuinely
// want those behaviors, while ToolPersonEnrich and ToolEmailFind now point at
// real email-enrichment providers.
