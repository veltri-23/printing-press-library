# Jira Cloud Platform CLI

Jira Cloud Platform REST API documentation

Learn more at [Jira Cloud Platform](http://www.atlassian.com).

Created by [@neektza](https://github.com/neektza) (Nikica Jokic).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `jira-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-jira` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install jira
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install jira --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install jira --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install jira --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install jira --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/project-management/jira/cmd/jira-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/jira-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install jira --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-jira --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-jira --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install jira --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/jira-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `JIRA_OAUTH2` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "jira-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "JIRA_OAUTH2": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Set Up Credentials

Get your access token from your API provider's developer portal, then store it:

```bash
jira-pp-cli auth set-token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Or set it via environment variable:

```bash
export JIRA_OAUTH2="your-token-here"
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
jira-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration and credentials.

### 4. Try Your First Command

```bash
jira-pp-cli attachment get mock-value
```

## Usage

Run `jira-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

- **`jira-pp-cli bulk submit-edit`** - Use this API to submit a bulk edit request and simultaneously edit multiple issues. There are limits applied to the number of issues and fields that can be edited. A single request can accommodate a maximum of 1000 issues (including subtasks) and 200 fields.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

 *  Global bulk change [permission](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-global-permissions/).

- **`jira-pp-cli bulk submit-move`** - Use this API to submit a bulk issue move request. You can move multiple issues from multiple projects in a single request, but they must all be moved to a single project, issue type, and parent. You can't move more than 1000 issues (including subtasks) at once.

#### Scenarios: ####

This is an early version of the API and it doesn't have full feature parity with the Bulk Move UI experience.

 *  Moving issue of type A to issue of type B in the same project or a different project: `SUPPORTED`
 *  Moving multiple issues of type A in one or more projects to multiple issues of type B in one of the source projects or a different project: `SUPPORTED`
 *  Moving issues of multiple issue types in one or more projects to issues of a single issue type in one of the source project or a different project: **`SUPPORTED`**  
    E.g. Moving issues of story and task issue types in project 1 and project 2 to issues of task issue type in project 3
 *  Moving a standard parent issue of type A with its multiple subtask issue types in one project to standard issue of type B and multiple subtask issue types in the same project or a different project: `SUPPORTED`
 *  Moving standard issues with their subtasks to a parent issue in the same project or a different project without losing their relation: `SUPPORTED`
 *  Moving an epic issue with its child issues to a different project without losing their relation: `SUPPORTED`  
    This usecase is **supported using multiple requests**. Move the epic in one request and then move the children in a separate request with target parent set to the epic issue id  
      
    (Alternatively, move them individually and stitch the relationship back with the Bulk Edit API)

#### Limits applied to bulk issue moves: ####

When using the bulk move, keep in mind that there are limits on the number of issues and fields you can include.

 *  You can move up to 1,000 issues in a single operation, including any subtasks.
 *  The total combined number of fields across all issues must not exceed 1,500,000. For example, if each issue includes 15,000 fields, then the maximum number of issues that can be moved is 100.

#### Context variables ####

The following context variables are available to Jira expressions evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends on various factors; usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain conditions.

 *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
 *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
 *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
 *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
 *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
 *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
 *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
 *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
 *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.

Also, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their types. Those variables can be accessed by key in the Jira expression. These variable types are available for use in a custom context:

 *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.
 *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.
 *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.
 *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an expression may return different results for different users depending on their permissions. For example, different users may see different comments on the same issue.  
Permission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example, `issue.sprint`).
- **`jira-pp-cli expression evaluate-jsisjira`** - Evaluates a Jira expression and returns its value. The difference between this and `eval` is that this endpoint uses the enhanced search API when evaluating JQL queries. This API is eventually consistent, unlike the strongly consistent `eval` API. This allows for better performance and scalability. In addition, this API's response for JQL evaluation is based on a scrolling view (backed by a `nextPageToken`) instead of a paginated view (backed by `startAt` and `totalCount`).

This resource can be used to test Jira expressions that you plan to use elsewhere, or to fetch data in a flexible way. Consult the [Jira expressions documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/) for more details.

Fields will be associated with all projects that share the same field configuration which the provided projects are using. This means that while the field will be associated with the requested projects, it will also be associated with any other projects that share the same field configuration.

If a success response is returned it means that the field association has been created in any applicable contexts where it wasn't already present.

Up to 50 fields and up to 100 projects can be associated in a single request. If more fields or projects are provided a 400 response will be returned.

### groups

This resource represents groups of users. Use it to get, create, find, and delete groups as well as add and remove users from groups. (\[WARNING\] The standard Atlassian group names are default names only and can be edited or deleted. For example, an admin or Atlassian support could delete the default group jira-software-users or rename it to jsw-users at any point. See https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/create-and-update-groups/ for details.)

- **`jira-pp-cli groups find`** - Returns a list of groups whose names contain a query string. A list of group names can be provided to exclude groups from the results.

The primary use case for this resource is to populate a group picker suggestions list. To this end, the returned object includes the `html` field where the matched query term is highlighted in the group name with the HTML strong tag. Also, the groups list is wrapped in a response object that contains a header for use in the picker, specifically *Showing X of Y matching groups*.

The list returns with the groups sorted. If no groups match the list criteria, an empty list is returned.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg). Anonymous calls and calls by users without the required permission return an empty list.

- **`jira-pp-cli groupuserpicker find-users-and-groups`** - Returns a list of users and groups matching a string. The string is used:

 *  for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required.
 *  for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name.

For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the display name *Tina*, email address matching the query, and the group *accounting* would be returned.

Optionally, the search can be refined to:

 *  the projects and issue types associated with a custom field, such as a user picker. The search can then be further refined to return only users and groups that have permission to view specific:
    
     *  projects.
     *  issue types.
    
    If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.
 *  not return Connect app users and groups.
 *  return groups that have a case-insensitive match with the query.

The primary use case for this resource is to populate a picker field suggestion list with users or groups. To this end, the returned object includes an `html` field for each list. This field highlights the matched query term in the item name with the HTML strong tag. Also, each list is wrapped in a response object that contains a header for use in a picker, specifically *Showing X of Y matching groups*.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg).

- **`jira-pp-cli issue bulk-delete-property`** - Deletes a property value from multiple issues. The issues to be updated can be specified by filter criteria.

The criteria the filter used to identify eligible issues are:

 *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
 *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.

If both criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy both criteria are considered eligible.

If no filter criteria are specified, all the issues visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES permission for the issue are considered eligible.

This operation is:

 *  transactional, either the property is deleted from all eligible issues or, when errors occur, no properties are deleted.
 *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

- **`jira-pp-cli issue bulk-fetch`** - Returns the details for a set of requested issues. You can request up to 100 issues.

Each issue is identified by its ID or key, however, if the identifier doesn't match an issue, a case-insensitive search and check for moved issues is performed. If a matching issue is found its details are returned, a 302 or other redirect is **not** returned.

Issues will be returned in ascending `id` order. If there are errors, Jira will return a list of issues which couldn't be fetched along with error messages.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Issues are included in the response where the user has:

 *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
 *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
- **`jira-pp-cli issue bulk-set-properties-by`** - Sets or updates entity property values on issues. Up to 10 entity properties can be specified for each issue and up to 100 issues included in the request.

The value of the request body must be a [valid](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627), non-empty JSON.

This operation is:

 *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.
 *  non-transactional. Updating some entities may fail. Such information will available in the task result.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

 *  *Browse projects* and *Edit issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project containing the issue.
 *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
- **`jira-pp-cli issue bulk-set-properties-list`** - Sets or updates a list of entity property values on issues. A list of up to 10 entity properties can be specified along with up to 10,000 issues on which to set or update that list of entity properties.

The value of the request body must be a [valid](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627), non-empty JSON. The maximum length of single issue property value is 32768 characters. This operation can be accessed anonymously.

This operation is:

 *  transactional, either all properties are updated in all eligible issues or, when errors occur, no properties are updated.
 *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

 *  *Browse projects* and *Edit issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project containing the issue.
 *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
- **`jira-pp-cli issue bulk-set-property`** - Sets a property value on multiple issues.

The value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/). Expressions must be computable with constant complexity when applied to a set of issues. Expressions must also comply with the [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions) that apply to all Jira expressions.

The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.

The filter identifies issues eligible for update using these criteria:

 *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
 *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.
 *  `hasProperty`:
    
     *  If *true*, only issues with the property are eligible.
     *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.

If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are eligible.

If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because without the property the property cannot have a value).

The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES permission for the issue are considered eligible.

This operation is:

 *  transactional, either all eligible issues are updated or, when errors occur, none are updated.
 *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

 *  *Edit issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for each issue.
- **`jira-pp-cli issue create`** - Creates an issue or, where the option to create subtasks is enabled in Jira, a subtask. A transition may be applied, to move the issue or subtask to a workflow step other than the default start step, and issue properties set.

The content of the issue or subtask is defined using `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are determined using the [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the same fields that appear on the issue's create screen. Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

 *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
 *  `parent` must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

In a next-gen project any issue may be made a child providing that the parent and child are members of the same project.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and *Create issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project in which the issue or subtask is created.

The content of each issue or subtask is defined using `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are determined using the [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the same fields that appear on the issues' create screens. Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

 *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
 *  `parent` the must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

The edits to the issue's fields are defined using `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be edited are determined using [ Get edit issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-editmeta-get).

The parent field may be set by key or ID. For standard issue types, the parent may be removed by setting `update.parent.set.none` to *true*. Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

### jql

This resource represents JQL search auto-complete details. Use it to obtain JQL search auto-complete data and suggestions for use in programmatic construction of queries or custom query builders. It also provides operations to:

 *  convert one or more JQL queries with user identifiers (username or user key) to equivalent JQL queries with account IDs.
 *  convert readable details in one or more JQL queries to IDs where a user doesn't have permission to view the entity whose details are readable.

- **`jira-pp-cli jql get-auto-complete`** - Returns reference data for JQL searches. This is a downloadable version of the documentation provided in [Advanced searching - fields reference](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/gwORLQ) and [Advanced searching - functions reference](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/hgORLQ), along with a list of JQL-reserved words. Use this information to assist with the programmatic creation of JQL queries or the validation of queries built in a custom query builder.

To filter visible field details by project or collapse non-unique fields by field type then [Get field reference data (POST)](#api-rest-api-3-jql-autocompletedata-post) can be used.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.
- **`jira-pp-cli jql get-auto-complete-post`** - Returns reference data for JQL searches. This is a downloadable version of the documentation provided in [Advanced searching - fields reference](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/gwORLQ) and [Advanced searching - functions reference](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/hgORLQ), along with a list of JQL-reserved words. Use this information to assist with the programmatic creation of JQL queries or the validation of queries built in a custom query builder.

This operation can filter the custom fields returned by project. Invalid project IDs in `projectIds` are ignored. System fields are always returned.

It can also return the collapsed field for custom fields. Collapsed fields enable searches to be performed across all fields with the same name and of the same field type. For example, the collapsed field `Component - Component[Dropdown]` enables dropdown fields `Component - cf[10061]` and `Component - cf[10062]` to be searched simultaneously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.
- **`jira-pp-cli jql get-field-auto-complete-for-query-string`** - Returns the JQL search auto complete suggestions for a field.

Suggestions can be obtained by providing:

 *  `fieldName` to get a list of all values for the field.
 *  `fieldName` and `fieldValue` to get a list of values containing the text in `fieldValue`.
 *  `fieldName` and `predicateName` to get a list of all predicate values for the field.
 *  `fieldName`, `predicateName`, and `predicateValue` to get a list of predicate values containing the text in `predicateValue`.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.
- **`jira-pp-cli jql get-precomputations`** - Returns the list of a function's precomputations along with information about when they were created, updated, and last used. Each precomputation has a `value` \- the JQL fragment to replace the custom function clause with.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** This API is only accessible to apps and apps can only inspect their own functions.

The new `read:app-data:jira` OAuth scope is 100% optional now, and not using it won't break your app. However, we recommend adding it to your app's scope list because we will eventually make it mandatory.
- **`jira-pp-cli jql get-precomputations-by-id`** - Returns function precomputations by IDs, along with information about when they were created, updated, and last used. Each precomputation has a `value` \- the JQL fragment to replace the custom function clause with.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** This API is only accessible to apps and apps can only inspect their own functions.

The new `read:app-data:jira` OAuth scope is 100% optional now, and not using it won't break your app. However, we recommend adding it to your app's scope list because we will eventually make it mandatory.
- **`jira-pp-cli jql match-issues`** - Checks whether one or more issues would be returned by one or more JQL queries.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None, however, issues are only matched against JQL queries where the user has:

 *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
 *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
- **`jira-pp-cli jql migrate-queries`** - Converts one or more JQL queries with user identifiers (username or user key) to equivalent JQL queries with account IDs.

You may wish to use this operation if your system stores JQL queries and you want to make them GDPR-compliant. For more information about GDPR-related changes, see the [migration guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/).

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira.
- **`jira-pp-cli jql parse-queries`** - Parses and validates JQL queries.

Validation is performed in context of the current user.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.
- **`jira-pp-cli jql sanitise-queries`** - Sanitizes one or more JQL queries by converting readable details into IDs where a user doesn't have permission to view the entity.

For example, if the query contains the clause *project = 'Secret project'*, and a user does not have browse permission for the project "Secret project", the sanitized query replaces the clause with *project = 12345"* (where 12345 is the ID of the project). If a user has the required permission, the clause is not sanitized. If the account ID is null, sanitizing is performed for an anonymous user.

Note that sanitization doesn't make the queries GDPR-compliant, because it doesn't remove user identifiers (username or user key). If you need to make queries GDPR-compliant, use [Convert user identifiers to account IDs in JQL queries](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-jql/#api-rest-api-3-jql-sanitize-post).

Before sanitization each JQL query is parsed. The queries are returned in the same order that they were passed.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
- **`jira-pp-cli jql update-precomputations`** - Update the precomputation value of a function created by a Forge/Connect app.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** An API for apps to update their own precomputations.

The new `write:app-data:jira` OAuth scope is 100% optional now, and not using it won't break your app. However, we recommend adding it to your app's scope list because we will eventually make it mandatory.

### label

This resource represents available labels. Use it to get available labels for the global label field.

- **`jira-pp-cli label get-all`** - Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of labels.

### license

Manage license

- **`jira-pp-cli license get-approximate-application-count`** - Returns the total approximate number of user accounts for a single Jira license. Note that this information is cached with a 7-day lifecycle and could be stale at the time of call.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
- **`jira-pp-cli license get-approximate-count`** - Returns the approximate number of user accounts across all Jira licenses. Note that this information is cached with a 7-day lifecycle and could be stale at the time of call.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

### mypermissions

Manage mypermissions

- **`jira-pp-cli mypermissions get-my-permissions`** - Returns a list of permissions indicating which permissions the user has. Details of the user's permissions can be obtained in a global, project, issue or comment context.

The user is reported as having a project permission:

 *  in the global context, if the user has the project permission in any project.
 *  for a project, where the project permission is determined using issue data, if the user meets the permission's criteria for any issue in the project. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project.
 *  for an issue, where a project permission is determined using issue data, if the user has the permission in the issue. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project containing the issue.
 *  for a comment, where the user has both the permission to browse the comment and the project permission for the comment's parent issue. Only the BROWSE\_PROJECTS permission is supported. If a `commentId` is provided whose `permissions` does not equal BROWSE\_PROJECTS, a 400 error will be returned.

This means that users may be shown as having an issue permission (such as EDIT\_ISSUES) in the global context or a project context but may not have the permission for any or all issues. For example, if Reporters have the EDIT\_ISSUES permission a user would be shown as having this permission in the global context or the context of a project, because any user can be a reporter. However, if they are not the user who reported the issue queried they would not have EDIT\_ISSUES permission for that issue.

For [Jira Service Management project permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/customize-jira-service-management-permissions/), this will be evaluated similarly to a user in the customer portal. For example, if the BROWSE\_PROJECTS permission is granted to Service Project Customer - Portal Access, any users with access to the customer portal will have the BROWSE\_PROJECTS permission.

Global permissions are unaffected by context.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.

### mypreferences

Manage mypreferences

- **`jira-pp-cli mypreferences get-locale`** - Returns the locale for the user.

If the user has no language preference set (which is the default setting) or this resource is accessed anonymous, the browser locale detected by Jira is returned. Jira detects the browser locale using the *Accept-Language* header in the request. However, if this doesn't match a locale available Jira, the site default locale is returned.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.
- **`jira-pp-cli mypreferences get-preference`** - Returns the value of a preference of the current user.

Note that these keys are deprecated:

### About permission schemes and grants ###

A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.

#### Holder object ####

The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"` and the value is group ID, `"value": "ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f"`.

The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

 *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
 *  `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.
 *  `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter`

The following `types` are available. The expected values for `parameter` and `value` are given in parentheses (some types may not have a `parameter` or `value`):

 *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
 *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
 *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
 *  `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID).
 *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).
 *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
 *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID).
 *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
 *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
 *  `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID).
 *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).

#### Built-in permissions ####

The [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.

### About project roles ###

[Project roles](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).

Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.

#### Members and actors ####

In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.

Actors may be set as [default members](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role) of the project role or set at the project level:

 *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
 *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
- **`jira-pp-cli role get-project-by-id`** - Gets the project role details and the default actors associated with the role. The list of default actors is sorted by display name.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
- **`jira-pp-cli role partial-update-project`** - Updates either the project role's name or its description.

You cannot update both the name and description at the same time using this operation. If you send a request with a name and a description only the name is updated.

 *  Access to Jira, to delete a property from the calling user's record.
- **`jira-pp-cli user find`** - Returns a list of active users that match the search string and property.

This operation first applies a filter to match the search string and property, and then takes the filtered users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user. To get all the users who match the search string and property, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg). Anonymous calls or calls by users without the required permission return empty search results.

 *  an updated issue, by providing the `issueKey` or `issueId`.
 *  to an issue during a transition (workflow action), by providing the `issueKey` or `issueId` and the transition id in `actionDescriptorId`. You can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions` option in the `expand` parameter of [ Get issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get).

In all these cases, you can pass an account ID to determine if a user can be assigned to an issue. The user is returned in the response if they can be assigned to the issue or issue transition.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that can be assigned the issue. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who can be assigned the issue, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) or *Assign issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)
- **`jira-pp-cli user find-bulk-assignable`** - Returns a list of users who can be assigned issues in one or more projects. The list may be restricted to users whose attributes match a string.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that can be assigned issues in the projects. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who can be assigned issues in the projects, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the structured query. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the structured query, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

 *  `[propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"` Returns users with the entity property value. For example, if user property `location` is set to value `{"office": {"country": "AU", "city": "Sydney"}}`, then it's possible to use `[location].office.city is "Sydney"` to match the user.

The list of issues can be extended as needed, as in *(PROJ-1, PROJ-2, ... PROJ-n)*. Statements can be combined using the `AND` and `OR` operators to form more complex queries. For example:

`is assignee of PROJ AND [propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"`
- **`jira-pp-cli user find-for-picker`** - Returns a list of users whose attributes match the query term. The returned object includes the `html` field where the matched query term is highlighted with the HTML strong tag. A list of account IDs can be provided to exclude users from the results.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the query term. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the query term, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

- **`jira-pp-cli user find-keys-by-query`** - Finds users with a structured query and returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of user keys.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the structured query. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the structured query, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

 *  `[propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"` Returns users with the entity property value. For example, if user property `location` is set to value `{"office": {"country": "AU", "city": "Sydney"}}`, then it's possible to use `[location].office.city is "Sydney"` to match the user.

The list of issues can be extended as needed, as in *(PROJ-1, PROJ-2, ... PROJ-n)*. Statements can be combined using the `AND` and `OR` operators to form more complex queries. For example:

`is assignee of PROJ AND [propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"`
- **`jira-pp-cli user find-with-all-permissions`** - Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria:

 *  their user attributes match a search string.
 *  they have a set of permissions for a project or issue.

If no search string is provided, a list of all users with the permissions is returned.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the search string and have permission for the project or issue. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the search string and have permission for the project or issue, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
jira-pp-cli attachment get mock-value

# JSON for scripting and agents
jira-pp-cli attachment get mock-value --json

# Filter to specific fields
jira-pp-cli attachment get mock-value --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
jira-pp-cli attachment get mock-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
jira-pp-cli attachment get mock-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
jira-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/jira-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `JIRA_OAUTH2` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `jira-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $JIRA_OAUTH2`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items
