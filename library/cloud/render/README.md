# Render CLI

**Every Render endpoint, plus diff, drift, cost, audit, and orphan analytics no other Render tool ships.**

render-pp-cli is the only Render CLI that lets you reason about your full Render footprint offline. It absorbs every command from the official CLI, MCP server, and Terraform provider, then adds the analytical primitives the dashboard refuses to: env-var diff/promote across environments, blueprint drift vs live state, cost rollups grouped by project, preview cleanup by age, and incident timelines merging deploys + events + audit logs.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `render-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-render` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install render
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install render --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install render --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install render --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install render --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/cloud/render/cmd/render-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/render-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install render --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-render --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-render --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install render --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/render-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `RENDER_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "render": {
      "command": "render-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "RENDER_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Render uses bearer-token auth. Set RENDER_API_KEY (generate one at https://dashboard.render.com/u/settings#api-keys), or run `render-pp-cli auth set-token <RENDER_API_KEY>` to paste it interactively. Every command sends `Authorization: Bearer <key>`; doctor verifies the key is live.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Paste your RENDER_API_KEY (or set the env var).
render-pp-cli auth set-token <RENDER_API_KEY>

# Confirm auth + reachability before doing anything else.
render-pp-cli doctor

# Populate the local SQLite store so cross-resource commands work offline.
render-pp-cli sync

# Smoke-check that data made it into the cache.
render-pp-cli services list --json

# First analytical command — flags any dashboard-edited resources.
render-pp-cli drift --blueprint render.yaml

# Friday cost rollup.
render-pp-cli cost --group-by project --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`env diff`** — Compare env vars between any two services, env-groups, or a service vs an env-group, three-way diff style.

  _Reach for this when promoting config across environments — it's the cheapest way to see what's actually different without click-through._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli env diff srv-staging-api srv-prod-api --json
  ```
- **`env promote`** — Copy env vars from a source service or env-group to a target with --only/--exclude/--dry-run.

  _Use when shipping a known-good staging config to prod without dragging dev-only keys along._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli env promote --from srv-staging-api --to srv-prod-api --exclude DEBUG_TOKEN --dry-run
  ```
- **`drift`** — Compare a checked-in render.yaml against live workspace state and report added/removed/modified entities by name.

  _Run this in CI to fail builds when someone edits prod through the dashboard instead of the blueprint._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli drift --blueprint render.yaml --json
  ```
- **`cost`** — Sum monthly cost across services, postgres, key-value, redis, and disks; group by project, environment, or owner.

  _Reach for this on the Friday cost-review or when finance asks 'what would happen if we downsized these three services?'_

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli cost --group-by project --json
  ```
- **`rightsize`** — For each service, fetch last --since 7d of CPU and memory; compute p95 utilization; flag services breaching --high or --low thresholds against plan capacity.

  _Run this before the cost rollup to find quick downsizing wins or services about to throttle._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli rightsize --since 7d --high 80 --low 20 --json
  ```

### Lifecycle hygiene
- **`preview-cleanup`** — List preview services older than --stale-days N; delete in bulk on --confirm.

  _Use when the monthly bill spikes and you suspect orphaned preview envs._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli preview-cleanup --stale-days 14 --confirm
  ```
- **`orphans`** — Find unattached disks, empty env-groups, custom-domains pointing at deleted services, registry credentials referenced by no service, and disk snapshots beyond retention.

  _Audit cleanup, billing review, and SOC 2 evidence-gathering all start here._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli orphans --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`env where`** — For a given env-var key, list every service and env-group that defines it with hash, length, and last-modified timestamp (never raw value).

  _First call during a credential rotation or a 'who uses this secret' audit._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli env where STRIPE_KEY --json
  ```
- **`incident-timeline`** — Merge deploys, events, and audit-logs for one service into one chronological table for a given window.

  _First command on-call should run during a 2am page after a deploy._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli incident-timeline srv-checkout-api --since 2h --json
  ```
- **`audit search`** — FTS5 search across cached audit logs by actor, target, action, and time window.

  _Use during SOC 2 evidence-gathering or to answer 'who rotated this key last quarter'._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli audit search --actor riley@example.com --target STRIPE_KEY --since 30d --json
  ```
- **`deploys diff`** — Show commit range, env-var changes, image-tag changes, and plan/region/scale changes between two deploys of one service.

  _First command in a post-deploy regression triage — answers 'what actually changed'._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli deploys diff srv-checkout-api dep-aaa dep-bbb --json
  ```

## Usage

Run `render-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Commands

### blueprints

[Blueprints](https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code) allow you to define your resources in a `render.yaml` file and automatically sync changes to your Render services.
The API gives control over how your Blueprints are used to create and manage resources.

- **`render-pp-cli blueprints disconnect`** - Disconnect the Blueprint with the provided ID.

Disconnecting a Blueprint stops automatic resource syncing via the associated `render.yaml` file. It does not _delete_ any services or other resources that were managed by the blueprint.
- **`render-pp-cli blueprints list`** - List Blueprints for the specified workspaces. If no workspaces are provided, returns all Blueprints the API key has access to.
- **`render-pp-cli blueprints retrieve`** - Retrieve the Blueprint with the provided ID.
- **`render-pp-cli blueprints update`** - Update the Blueprint with the provided ID.
- **`render-pp-cli blueprints validate`** - Validate a `render.yaml` Blueprint file without creating or modifying any resources. This endpoint checks the syntax and structure of the Blueprint, validates that all required fields are present, and returns a plan indicating the resources that would be created.

Requests to this endpoint use `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`. The provided Blueprint file cannot exceed 10MB in size.

### cron-jobs

Manage cron jobs

### disks

[Disks](https://render.com/docs/disks) allow you to attach persistent storage to your services.

- **`render-pp-cli disks add`** - Attach a persistent disk to a web service, private service, or background worker.

The service must be redeployed for the disk to be attached.
- **`render-pp-cli disks delete`** - Delete a persistent disk attached to a service.

**All data on the disk will be lost.** The disk's associated service will immediately lose access to it.
- **`render-pp-cli disks list`** - List persistent disks matching the provided filters. If no filters are provided, returns all disks you have permissions to view.
- **`render-pp-cli disks retrieve`** - Retrieve the persistent disk with the provided ID.
- **`render-pp-cli disks update`** - Update the persistent disk with the provided ID.

The disk's associated service must be deployed and active for updates to take effect.

When resizing a disk, the new size must be greater than the current size.

### env-groups

Manage env groups

- **`render-pp-cli env-groups create`** - Create a new environment group.
- **`render-pp-cli env-groups delete`** - Delete the environment group with the provided ID, including all environment variables and secret files it contains.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
render-pp-cli blueprints list

# JSON for scripting and agents
render-pp-cli blueprints list --json

# Filter to specific fields
render-pp-cli blueprints list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
render-pp-cli blueprints list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
render-pp-cli blueprints list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
render-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/render-public-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RENDER_API_KEY` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `render-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $RENDER_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 Unauthorized on every command** — Run `render-pp-cli doctor`. If it reports `auth: failed`, regenerate the API key at dashboard.render.com/u/settings#api-keys and re-export RENDER_API_KEY.
- **drift / cost / orphans return empty results** — Run `render-pp-cli sync` to populate the local cache; then re-run the command.
- **429 Too Many Requests during sync** — Pass `--rate-limit 10` to slow the cursor walker, or wait 60s. Render rate-limits are not documented but the CLI surfaces the `render-request-id` header in the error for support.
- **logs tail disconnects after a few minutes** — The /v1/logs/subscribe SSE stream times out periodically; re-run the command.
