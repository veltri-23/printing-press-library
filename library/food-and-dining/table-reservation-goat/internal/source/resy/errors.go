// failures into the same JSON error categories agents already key on.

	// without a stored Resy token. The CLI surfaces this as `auth_required`

	// ErrSlotTaken is returned when /3/details or /3/book reports the slot
	// is no longer available. Empirically Resy returns a 410 or a 200 with
	// an error envelope; the client folds both into this sentinel.
	ErrSlotTaken = errors.New("resy: slot is no longer available")

	// payment_methods. Resy requires a card on file even for "free"

	// ErrCanaryUnrecognizedBody is the catch-all canary for API drift.
	// Returned when the parser can't make sense of a 200 response — useful
	// for distinguishing genuine API shape changes from upstream outages.
