Resolves a Food52 recipe slug, story slug, or full Food52 URL to its
canonical URL and prints it. Pair with --launch to also open it in the
default browser.

The default is "print only" rather than "launch" because mock-mode
verifiers and CI/agent harnesses often invoke commands with placeholder
args, and shelling out to the OS browser there would spam browser tabs
with bogus URLs. Add --launch when you actually want the browser to open.

Detection rules:
- If the arg contains "/recipes/" → recipe URL
- If the arg contains "/story/" or "/blog/" → article URL
- If the arg starts with http/https → resolved verbatim
- Otherwise → treated as a recipe slug (the most common case)
