# Allrecipes CLI

**Every Allrecipes recipe in your terminal — cached as data, with pantry-aware search, Bayesian-smoothed ranking, and one-line grocery lists.**

Search Allrecipes' 250k-recipe corpus from the command line, fetch a full recipe as parsed JSON-LD (ingredients with quantity+unit+name, instructions, nutrition, ratings, Made-It count), aggregate grocery lists from a meal plan, scale recipes, and export to clean markdown. Every recipe you fetch lands in a local SQLite store, which unlocks `pantry` (which recipes can I cook with what I have), `with-ingredient` (reverse index), `top-rated` with Bayesian smoothing (no more 1-review 5-star noise), and `cookbook` (export a category as a personal cookbook). Recipe detail pages are walled by Cloudflare; one-time `auth login --chrome` captures a clearance cookie from your browser — no Allrecipes account needed.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `allrecipes-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-allrecipes` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install allrecipes
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install allrecipes --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install allrecipes --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install allrecipes --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install allrecipes --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/food-and-dining/allrecipes/cmd/allrecipes-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/allrecipes-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install allrecipes --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-allrecipes --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-allrecipes --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install allrecipes --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

The bundle reuses your local browser session — set it up first if you haven't:

```bash
allrecipes-pp-cli auth login --chrome
```

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/allrecipes-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/food-and-dining/allrecipes/cmd/allrecipes-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "allrecipes": {
      "command": "allrecipes-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

Browse and search work without any auth. Recipe detail pages need a Cloudflare clearance cookie — run `allrecipes-pp-cli auth login --chrome` once to capture one from your browser. This is bot-protection clearance, not an Allrecipes account login: no username, no password, no token tied to a user. The CLI does not support saved-recipes / meal-plan / profile features that require an actual Allrecipes account.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-time: capture a Cloudflare clearance cookie from your browser. Required for recipe detail pages.
allrecipes-pp-cli auth login --chrome

# Search the live site; results land in your local cache for offline reuse. Browse/search work without clearance.
allrecipes-pp-cli search "brownies" --limit 5 --agent

# Fetch a full recipe as parsed JSON-LD; --select narrows the payload.
allrecipes-pp-cli recipe https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9599/quick-and-easy-brownies/ --agent --select recipeIngredient,totalTime,aggregateRating

# Rescale ingredients by servings.
allrecipes-pp-cli scale https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9599/quick-and-easy-brownies/ --servings 16

# Match cached recipes against what you already have.
allrecipes-pp-cli pantry --pantry-file ~/pantry.txt --query chicken --agent

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`pantry`** — Score Allrecipes recipes against your pantry — see which ones you can actually cook tonight without a grocery run.

  _When the user says 'what can I make with what I've got', this is the only command that knows the answer._

  ```bash
  allrecipes-pp-cli pantry --pantry-file ~/pantry.txt --query brownies --agent
  ```
- **`with-ingredient`** — Find every cached recipe that uses a given ingredient — a SQL view across your local corpus.

  _Use this when the user starts from an ingredient they want to use up, not a dish name._

  ```bash
  allrecipes-pp-cli with-ingredient buttermilk --top 10 --agent
  ```
- **`dietary`** — Filter cached recipes by gluten-free / vegan / low-carb using JSON-LD keywords plus ingredient-name patterns.

  _Use this when dietary restrictions are non-negotiable and the user wants more than what the site's diet category page surfaces._

  ```bash
  allrecipes-pp-cli dietary --type gluten-free --top 20 --agent
  ```

### Ranking that beats the website
- **`top-rated`** — Rank recipes by Bayesian-smoothed rating — proven popular wins over 1-review 5-star noise.

  _Pick this over raw search when the agent wants proven recipes, not freshly-uploaded 5-star outliers._

  ```bash
  allrecipes-pp-cli top-rated brownies --smooth-c 200 --limit 10 --agent
  ```
- **`quick`** — Top-rated recipes that fit a strict time cap — Allrecipes' UI cannot enforce one, but the local cache can.

  _Use this when the user's constraint is time, not dish — 'what can I make in 25 minutes that's actually good'._

  ```bash
  allrecipes-pp-cli quick --max-minutes 30 --query chicken --agent
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`cookbook`** — Compile a top-rated category into a single markdown cookbook with TOC, ingredients, and instructions.

  _When the user asks for a curated bundle (gifts, meal-plan packs), this builds it in one command._

  ```bash
  allrecipes-pp-cli cookbook --category italian --top 20 --output italian-cookbook.md
  ```
- **`grocery-list`** — Aggregate ingredients from many recipes into a deduped, agent-readable shopping list.

  _Use this at the end of a meal plan — one call replaces five scrolls through ingredient lists._

  ```bash
  allrecipes-pp-cli grocery-list https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9599/quick-and-easy-brownies/ https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16354/easy-meatloaf/ --agent
  ```

### Reachability mitigation
- **`doctor`** — Health check that names the Cloudflare 'Just a moment...' interstitial by inspecting the response body, then advises the browser-chrome transport.

  _When the CLI breaks because of bot detection, the agent gets a specific, actionable error rather than a generic timeout._

  ```bash
  allrecipes-pp-cli doctor
  ```

allrecipes-pp-cli search brownies --limit 5

# JSON for scripting and agents
allrecipes-pp-cli search brownies --limit 5 --json

# Filter to specific fields

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
allrecipes-pp-cli search brownies --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Freshness

This CLI owns bounded freshness for registered store-backed read command paths. In `--data-source auto` mode, covered commands check the local SQLite store before serving results; stale or missing resources trigger a bounded refresh, and refresh failures fall back to the existing local data with a warning. `--data-source local` never refreshes, and `--data-source live` reads the API without mutating the local store.

Set `ALLRECIPES_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` to disable the pre-read freshness hook while preserving the selected data source.

JSON outputs that use the generated provenance envelope include freshness metadata at `meta.freshness`. This metadata describes the freshness decision for the covered command path; it does not claim full historical backfill or API-specific enrichment.

## Health Check

```bash
allrecipes-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/allrecipes-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:
- `ALLRECIPES_COOKIES`

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `allrecipes-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $ALLRECIPES_COOKIES`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **doctor reports clearance_required: true** — Run `allrecipes-pp-cli auth login --chrome` to capture a fresh Cloudflare clearance cookie from your browser. Cookies expire periodically; re-run when doctor flags it again.
- **recipe fetch returns 403 with cf-mitigated: challenge** — Same as above — your clearance cookie is missing or expired. Run `allrecipes-pp-cli auth login --chrome` to refresh it. If your network IP is flagged independently, try a different connection.
- **search returns 0 results** — Allrecipes search is text-only; URL-style filter syntax is not supported. Use plain words, then narrow with `--max-minutes` or pipe to `top-rated` for client-side ranking.
- **grocery-list output has duplicate ingredients with different units** — Unit normalization is best-effort; pass `--raw-quantities` to see source strings and aggregate manually for edge cases.
- **pantry/with-ingredient returns no results despite expected matches** — These commands query the local cache only — run `sync` or fetch a few recipes first to populate it. Use `cache stats` to confirm the corpus is non-empty.

## HTTP Transport

This CLI uses Chrome-compatible HTTP transport over HTTP/3 for browser-facing endpoints. It does not require a resident browser process for normal API calls.
