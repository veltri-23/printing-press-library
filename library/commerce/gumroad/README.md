# Gumroad CLI

**Gumroad's seller API as an agent-ready CLI and MCP server.**

This tool wraps Gumroad's documented OAuth API for products, files, covers, variants, offer codes, custom fields, resource subscriptions, sales, subscribers, licenses, payouts, tax forms, and earnings. It also adds the Printing Press local sync/search/analytics layer so agents can answer seller questions from a consistent local snapshot instead of repeatedly walking paginated endpoints.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `gumroad-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-gumroad` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install gumroad
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install gumroad --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install gumroad --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install gumroad --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install gumroad --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/gumroad/cmd/gumroad-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/gumroad-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install gumroad --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-gumroad --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-gumroad --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install gumroad --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/gumroad-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `GUMROAD_ACCESS_TOKEN` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gumroad": {
      "command": "gumroad-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "GUMROAD_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Create a Gumroad OAuth application, authorize it with the scopes needed for your workflow, and provide the resulting access token as GUMROAD_ACCESS_TOKEN. The MCP bundle exposes this as a sensitive user configuration value.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Confirm the token is present and the API is reachable.
gumroad-pp-cli doctor

# List products in agent-friendly JSON.
gumroad-pp-cli products list --agent

# Sync seller data for local search and analytics.
gumroad-pp-cli sync --resources products,sales,subscribers,payouts --latest-only --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local seller intelligence

- **`sync --resources products,sales,subscribers,payouts --latest-only --json`** — Refresh a local SQLite snapshot of the seller-facing Gumroad resources that agents inspect most often.

  _Use this before research or reporting tasks so later searches and analytics are grounded in one consistent seller snapshot._

  ```bash
  gumroad-pp-cli sync --resources products,sales,subscribers,payouts --latest-only --json
  ```
- **`search`** — Search locally synced products, sales, subscribers, payouts, and tax records through one command.

  _Use this when the user remembers a buyer, product, license, or payout clue but not the exact Gumroad object ID._

  ```bash
  gumroad-pp-cli search "annual plan" --data-source local --json --limit 20
  ```
- **`analytics`** — Group and count synced Gumroad records locally for fast summaries without additional API traffic.

  _Use this for lightweight revenue, subscriber, product, and payout triage after a sync._

  ```bash
  gumroad-pp-cli analytics --type sales --group-by product_id --limit 10 --json
  ```

### Operational monitoring

- **`tail`** — Poll selected Gumroad resources and emit NDJSON changes for scripts or agent monitors.

  _Use this for one-off checks after a launch, refund, payout, or product update._

  ```bash
  gumroad-pp-cli tail --resource sales --interval 30s --json
  ```

gumroad-pp-cli earnings --year 42 --json

# Filter to specific fields
gumroad-pp-cli earnings --year 42 --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
gumroad-pp-cli earnings --year 42 --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
gumroad-pp-cli earnings --year 42 --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
gumroad-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/gumroad-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GUMROAD_ACCESS_TOKEN` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `gumroad-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $GUMROAD_ACCESS_TOKEN`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **Gumroad returns a scope error.** — Re-authorize the OAuth application with the endpoint scope shown in the command help, such as view_sales, edit_sales, edit_products, view_payouts, or view_tax_data.
- **File upload completion fails after a retry.** — Start a new /files/presign flow; Gumroad upload IDs are one-use after /files/complete.
