# FedEx CLI

**REST-native FedEx CLI for small business shippers, with rate-shopping, bulk CSV labels, an address book, and a local SQLite ledger no other tool has.**

FedEx retires its SOAP APIs on June 1, 2026 and every existing wrapper goes dark. fedex-pp-cli ships the full FedEx OAuth2 REST surface as a single static Go binary. For small-business shippers it adds the four things SaaS competitors charge for: rate-shopping across every service type, bulk-CSV label printing with adaptive rate limits, a local address book, and a SQLite ledger that powers spend reports, archive search, and accounting export.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `fedex-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-fedex` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install fedex
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install fedex --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install fedex --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install fedex --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install fedex --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/fedex/cmd/fedex-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/fedex-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install fedex --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-fedex --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-fedex --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install fedex --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/fedex-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `FEDEX_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/fedex/cmd/fedex-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fedex": {
      "command": "fedex-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "FEDEX_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

FedEx uses OAuth2 client_credentials. Run `fedex auth login` once with your sandbox or production Client ID and Client Secret; the CLI mints a 1-hour bearer token, caches it on disk, and refreshes proactively before expiry. Production label printing requires per-project Bar Code Analysis Group (BAG) approval from FedEx — `fedex doctor` surfaces approval status before you hit it.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Mint a bearer token from FedEx OAuth2 client_credentials and cache it
fedex auth login --client-id $FEDEX_API_KEY --client-secret $FEDEX_SECRET_KEY --env sandbox

# Verify auth, sandbox/prod routing, and surface any BAG approval gaps before you hit them at ship-time
fedex doctor

# Compare every applicable service type ranked by cost — the most useful one-liner this CLI offers
fedex rate shop --from 90210 --to 10001 --weight 5lb --json --select rates.serviceType,rates.totalNetCharge

# Save a recipient to the local address book so you do not retype it for every shipment
fedex address save --name acme --street '500 Main St' --city Denver --state CO --zip 80202 --country US

# Batch-create labels with adaptive rate limiting; resumable on partial failure
fedex ship bulk --csv orders.csv --service GROUND --resume

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Save money, save time
- **`rate shop`** — Quote rates across every applicable service type in parallel and rank by cost, transit days, or cost-per-day.

  _When picking the cheapest viable service for a shipment, this collapses 6+ API calls into one ranked answer. The headline cost-saving command for SMB shippers._

  ```bash
  fedex rate shop --from 90210 --to 10001 --weight 5lb --json --select rates.serviceType,rates.totalNetCharge,rates.transitTime
  ```
- **`ship bulk`** — Create labels for a CSV of orders with adaptive rate limiting, per-row PASS/FAIL accounting, and resume-from-last-success.

  _The 'I ship 30 packages a day' workflow. Replaces clicking through FedEx Ship Manager one label at a time._

  ```bash
  fedex ship bulk --csv orders.csv --service GROUND --output labels/ --resume
  ```
- **`return create`** — Generate a Ground Call Tag (return label) against an existing tracking number with one command, optionally emailing it to the recipient.

  _E-commerce customer-service workflow. Issuing a return label is the most common post-sale interaction._

  ```bash
  fedex return create --tracking 794633071234 --reason damaged --email customer@example.com
  ```
- **`address validate`** — SHA-256-keyed local cache prevents re-billing the FedEx Address Validation API for repeat lookups.

  _Direct cost savings — the only feature with a quantifiable per-call $ impact._

  ```bash
  fedex address validate --street '1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy' --city 'Mountain View' --state CA --zip 94043 --country US --cache
  ```
- **`ship etd`** — Single-command Electronic Trade Documents shipping: uploads commercial invoice, captures docId, and stitches it into the shipment create call.

  _International shipments require ETD; this collapses an error-prone multi-step into one atomic action._

  ```bash
  fedex ship etd --invoice invoice.pdf --orig CN --dest US --recipient-name 'Acme' --weight 2kg --service FEDEX_INTERNATIONAL_PRIORITY
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`address save`** — Save frequently-used recipients to a local address book; reference them by name in ship commands.

  _Ergonomic parity with paid SaaS competitors. Eliminates retyping addresses for repeat customers._

  ```bash
  fedex address save acme --street '500 Main St' --city Denver --state CO --zip 80202 --country US
  ```
- **`track diff`** — Show only the tracking events that have appeared since the last poll for each tracking number in the local store.

  _Replaces tracking-poll dedupe glue agents would otherwise write._

  ```bash
  fedex track diff --since 1h --json
  ```
- **`track watch`** — Continuously poll a set of tracking numbers and emit new events to stdout, a webhook, or a file as they arrive. Polling alternative to FedEx push notifications.

  _Most SMBs don't have provisioned push webhooks. Polling daemon is the universal alternative._

  ```bash
  fedex track watch --tracking 794633071234 --interval 10m --webhook https://example.com/hook
  ```
- **`archive`** — SQLite FTS5 search across every shipment in the local archive — recipient name, address, reference, tracking number, service.

  _'Did we ship to ACME last week?' — a question SMBs ask constantly._

  ```bash
  fedex archive 'warehouse 47' --service GROUND --json
  ```
- **`spend report`** — Sum of net charges per service type, lane, or account from the local rate-quote and shipment ledger.

  _'How much did I spend on FedEx last month?' — the question every SMB owner asks._

  ```bash
  fedex spend report --since 30d --by service --json
  ```
- **`export`** — Dump shipments + charges + tracking events as CSV or JSON for QuickBooks/Xero reconciliation.

  _Closes the loop on accounting reconciliation without manual data entry._

  ```bash
  fedex export --format csv --since 30d --output fedex-april.csv
  ```
- **`manifest`** — Generate a printable PDF/text summary of every shipment created today from the local archive, optionally invoking the Ground EOD close API.

  _Closes the warehouse-day workflow loop in one command._

  ```bash
  fedex manifest --date 2026-05-02 --close --output manifest.md
  ```
- **`sql`** — Direct SQLite SELECT queries against shipments, rate_quotes, tracking_events, address_validations, addresses tables.

  _Escape hatch for arbitrary analytics over the local ledger._

  ```bash
  fedex sql "select serviceType, count(*) as n, sum(net_charge) as spend from shipments where created_at > date('now','-30 days') group by serviceType order by spend desc"
  ```

### Setup smoothness
- **`doctor`** — Verifies OAuth auth, sandbox/prod routing, account-number format, label-format compatibility, and surfaces BAG (Bar Code Analysis Group) approval status.

  _Avoids the most common 'why won't my labels print' failure mode for first-time users._

  ```bash
  fedex doctor
  ```

## Cookbook

Patterns combining multiple commands to solve real shipping workflows.

### Pick the cheapest service for a single shipment

```bash
fedex-pp-cli rate shop --from 98101 --to 10001 --weight 5lb \
  --json --select 'rates.service_type,rates.net_amount,rates.transit_days' \
  --account "$FEDEX_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"
```

The `selected=1` row is the cheapest viable service. Each quote is also persisted to the local `rate_quotes` ledger so spend reports can attribute follow-on shipments.

### Compare cost vs transit

```bash
fedex-pp-cli rate shop --from 98101 --to 10001 --weight 12 --rank-by transit --json
```

Rank by `--rank-by transit` to surface fastest service first, then inspect `net_amount` to see the cost premium.

### Bulk-ship from a CSV with safe resume

```bash
# First run — adaptive rate limiting, low concurrency, write labels to ./labels/
fedex-pp-cli ship bulk --csv orders.csv --service FEDEX_GROUND \
  --output ./labels --concurrency 3 --account "$FEDEX_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"

# Network blip? Re-run with --resume; rows already in the archive are skipped
fedex-pp-cli ship bulk --csv orders.csv --resume --account "$FEDEX_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"
```

### Capture only-new tracking events for a webhook

```bash
# One-shot diff — ideal for a cron job or CI step
fedex-pp-cli track diff 794633071234 794633071235 --json

# Long-running watch with webhook fan-out
fedex-pp-cli track watch --tracking 794633071234 \
  --interval 5m --webhook https://hooks.example.com/track
```

### Issue a return label and email it to the customer

```bash
fedex-pp-cli return create --tracking 794633071234 \
  --reason damaged --email customer@example.com \
  --account "$FEDEX_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"
```

### Cache address validations to avoid re-billing

```bash
fedex-pp-cli address validate \
  --street '1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy' --city 'Mountain View' \
  --state CA --zip 94043 --country US --cache
```

The SHA-256-keyed local cache returns the same FedEx-validated payload on repeat calls without hitting the API.

### Save a recipient and reuse it

```bash
fedex-pp-cli address save acme \
  --contact-name "ACME Corp" --street "1 Anvil Way" \
  --city Burbank --state CA --zip 91505 --country US

# Look it up later
fedex-pp-cli address list --json --select name,city,state
```

### Search the local shipment archive (FTS5)

```bash
# Plain word search across recipient/reference/tracking
fedex-pp-cli archive "acme corp"

# Filter by service and recency, render as table
fedex-pp-cli archive --service FEDEX_GROUND --since 720h --limit 25
```

### Run ad-hoc SQL against the local store

```bash
# Top spend lanes in the last 30 days
fedex-pp-cli sql "
  SELECT origin_postal, dest_postal, SUM(net_amount) AS spend
  FROM rate_quotes
  WHERE created_at >= datetime('now','-30 days')
  GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 3 DESC LIMIT 10"
```

### Build a daily manifest, optionally close end-of-day

```bash
# Markdown manifest of every shipment created today
fedex-pp-cli manifest --output today.md

# Same thing, then call FedEx end-of-day to formally close it
fedex-pp-cli manifest --close
```

### Compose a spend report grouped by service or lane

```bash
fedex-pp-cli spend report --by service --since 720h
fedex-pp-cli spend report --by lane --since 168h --json
```

### Pre-flight check before a bulk run

```bash
# Verify auth, sandbox/prod routing, and BAG approval status
fedex-pp-cli doctor

# Verify a specific call without sending it
fedex-pp-cli ship bulk --csv orders.csv --dry-run
```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
fedex-pp-cli addresses

# JSON for scripting and agents
fedex-pp-cli addresses --json

# Filter to specific fields
fedex-pp-cli addresses --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
fedex-pp-cli addresses --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
fedex-pp-cli addresses --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Retryable** - creates return "already exists" on retry, deletes return "already deleted"
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
fedex-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/fedex-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:
- `FEDEX_API_KEY`
- `FEDEX_SECRET_KEY`

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `fedex-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $FEDEX_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **HTTP 403 with no body, then no responses for 10 minutes** — You hit the per-IP throttle (1 req/s sustained for 2 min). Use `fedex ship bulk --concurrency 1` or wait 10 minutes; cliutil.AdaptiveLimiter prevents this when used
- **401 NOT.AUTHORIZED.ERROR on every call** — Token expired or credentials wrong. Run `fedex auth login` again with valid Client ID + Client Secret
- **PDF labels won't print on thermal printer** — Pass --label-format ZPLII or EPL2 to ship create; thermal printers can't render PDF directly
- **Production ship returns BAG-not-approved error** — Production label printing requires per-project FedEx Bar Code Analysis Group approval. Run `fedex doctor` for status; submit your BAG application via the FedEx developer portal
- **track diff returns nothing despite known new events** — Run `fedex track number <num>` first to seed the local store; diff compares against what's already cached
