# Pushover CLI

**Pushover from the terminal: send alerts, watch emergency receipts, inspect quota, and keep a redacted local notification ledger.**

pushover-pp-cli covers the full official API instead of stopping at send-message. It adds agent-safe env defaults, receipt lifecycle tools, quota preflight, and local history so alerts are auditable.

Created by [@twidtwid](https://github.com/twidtwid) (Todd Dailey).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `pushover-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-pushover` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pushover
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pushover --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pushover --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pushover --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pushover --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/pushover/cmd/pushover-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/pushover-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pushover --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-pushover --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-pushover --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pushover --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/pushover-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pushover": {
      "command": "pushover-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Use a Pushover application token and user key. Set PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN and PUSHOVER_USER_KEY, or pass --app-token and --user-key explicitly. Legacy PUSHOVER_TOKEN/PUSHOVER_USER names are accepted for local compatibility.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check send budget before test notifications
pushover-pp-cli quota --json

# Send a low-priority test notification
pushover-pp-cli notify "Printing Press test" --priority low --json

# Review sends recorded by the CLI
pushover-pp-cli history list --since 24h --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`notify`** — Send a notification from an argument or stdin with env/config defaults, named priorities, and emergency validation.

  _Lets agents send test or operational notifications without leaking token values or remembering the raw endpoint shape._

  ```bash
  pushover-pp-cli notify "Printing Press test" --priority low --json
  ```

### Receipt operations
- **`emergency watch`** — Send or monitor an emergency notification receipt, polling acknowledgement status and supporting cancellation.

  _Turns emergency notifications from fire-and-forget sends into an auditable on-call workflow._

  ```bash
  pushover-pp-cli emergency watch --receipt <receipt> --poll-interval 30s --cancel-on-timeout --json
  ```

### Operational safety
- **`quota`** — Show monthly send limit, remaining sends, and reset time from the app limits endpoint.

  _Agents can check send budget before fanout or repeated test sends._

  ```bash
  pushover-pp-cli quota --json
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`history`** — Search and export a local redacted ledger of notifications sent by this CLI and receipt outcomes.

  _Shows what this CLI sent, when, with which priority, without storing raw user keys or tokens._

  ```bash
  pushover-pp-cli history list --since 24h --json
  ```
- **`inbox sync`** — Download Open Client messages into local SQLite before optional server-side delete-through.

  _Makes Pushover usable as both send channel and retrievable inbox for agents that own an Open Client device._

  ```bash
  pushover-pp-cli inbox sync --device-id <device-id> --json
  ```

pushover-pp-cli groups list --app-token your-token-here

# JSON for scripting and agents
pushover-pp-cli groups list --app-token your-token-here --json

# Filter to specific fields
pushover-pp-cli groups list --app-token your-token-here --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
pushover-pp-cli groups list --app-token your-token-here --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
pushover-pp-cli groups list --app-token your-token-here --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
pushover-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/pushover-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

## Troubleshooting
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **notification send returns invalid user** — Run users validate with the same user key and optional device before saving the destination
- **priority 2 send fails** — Provide retry >= 30 and expire <= 10800; use emergency watch for a safer flow
- **429 quota response** — Run quota and wait until reset or reduce send volume
