# Twilio CLI

**Every Twilio Core feature, plus offline message and call history, FTS, and SQL-grade analytics no other Twilio tool ships.**

Twilio's official CLI is a thin Node wrapper with 1–3 second cold start and no local cache. This CLI syncs your Messages, Calls, Recordings, UsageRecords, and IncomingPhoneNumbers into a local SQLite store you can grep, SQL, and aggregate offline. It ships every v2010 endpoint as a typed Cobra command, plus 12 novel features the Twilio ecosystem does not have: delivery-failure breakdowns, subaccount spend matrices, call-trace stitches, TCPA opt-out checks, idle-number reclamation, webhook-orphan audits, and more.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `twilio-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-twilio` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install twilio
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install twilio --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install twilio --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install twilio --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install twilio --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/twilio/cmd/twilio-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/twilio-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install twilio --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-twilio --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-twilio --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install twilio --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/twilio-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/twilio/cmd/twilio-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "twilio": {
      "command": "twilio-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID": "<account-sid>",
        "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "<auth-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Twilio uses HTTP Basic auth. You can authenticate with your Account SID (AC...) plus your Auth Token, OR with a scoped API Key SID (SK...) plus its Secret. The Account SID is always required because it is part of the URL path. Run `twilio-pp-cli doctor` to verify your credentials, detect whether the key is master or scoped, and warn on parent/subaccount mismatches.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set credentials (HTTP Basic auth):
#   Account SID + Auth Token (master) — preferred when you control the account
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

#   Or scoped API Key (revocable without rotating the master token)
# export TWILIO_API_KEY_SID=SKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# export TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Verify auth wiring and connectivity. Reports auth_mode (master vs scoped) and
# warns on AC/SK prefix mismatches before any real work.
twilio-pp-cli doctor --json

# Local-only freshness check: which resources have data and how old is it?
twilio-pp-cli sync-status --json

# Sync the high-gravity tables before running analytics:
twilio-pp-cli sync --resources messages,calls,incoming-phone-numbers

# First analytic against the local store — failures by error code and destination country
twilio-pp-cli delivery-failures --since 7d --json

# Find phone numbers you are paying for but have not used in 30 days
twilio-pp-cli idle-numbers --since 30d --json

# Group IncomingPhoneNumbers by webhook URL to flag orphans (--probe to HEAD-check)
twilio-pp-cli webhook-audit --json
```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`delivery-failures`** — See why messages failed last week, grouped by error code and destination country, with the dollar cost of those failures totaled.

  _When debugging delivery, agents need the failure distribution, not 4000 individual rows. This command answers 'why is delivery degraded' in one query._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli delivery-failures --since 7d --json
  ```
- **`subaccount-spend`** — One CSV with every subaccount's last-month spend pivoted across SMS, MMS, voice, and recording categories — the agency-billing report nobody else ships.

  _For agency operators, this is the entire monthly billing report in one command. Agents can run it with --period thisMonth for a live forecast._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli subaccount-spend --period last-month --csv > march-billing.csv
  ```
- **`message-status-funnel`** — Distribution of message terminal statuses (delivered, failed, undelivered, sent) with delivery-rate percentages and median time-to-delivery.

  _Operations dashboards need the funnel, not the raw rows. One query is the whole 'is delivery healthy right now' answer._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli message-status-funnel --since 24h --json
  ```
- **`call-disposition`** — Cross-tab of call Status (completed, busy, no-answer, failed, canceled) by AnsweredBy (human, machine_start, fax), with dollar cost per bucket.

  _Outbound campaign tuning depends on knowing the human-pickup rate vs voicemail rate. Agents can answer this without paging through thousands of call records._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli call-disposition --since 7d --json
  ```

### Cross-entity stitches
- **`call-trace`** — Given a CallSid, return everything that happened on that call: metadata, recordings, transcriptions, conference participation — in one structured output.

  _On-call engineers paged about a dropped call need the full picture in seconds, not three API round trips while the customer waits._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli call-trace CAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --json
  ```
- **`idle-numbers`** — Phone numbers you are paying for but have not used to send or receive in N days — with the dollar amount you are wasting per month.

  _At $1/number/month, agencies running 100+ subaccount numbers can save hundreds annually. Agents can run it as a monthly cleanup task._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli idle-numbers --since 30d --json
  ```
- **`webhook-audit`** — Group your IncomingPhoneNumbers by their Voice/SMS webhook URL to find single-use URLs that may be orphans pointing at deleted endpoints. Add --probe for a live HEAD check.

  _Orphan webhooks silently fail incoming calls and SMS. Quarterly audit is cheap insurance against silent dropped traffic._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli webhook-audit --probe --json
  ```
- **`conversation`** — All messages and calls involving one phone number, merged into a single timestamped timeline with in/out arrows, body, and duration.

  _When investigating a customer complaint or fraud claim, the full back-and-forth is one query. Agents can answer 'what did we say to this number' without four searches._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli conversation +14155551234 --json
  ```

### Compliance & audit
- **`opt-out-violations`** — Find numbers that texted STOP/UNSUBSCRIBE/END/QUIT and any messages your account sent to them afterwards — the TCPA exposure check the Twilio API has no resource for.

  _TCPA fines are $500–$1,500 per violation. Compliance teams audit for this quarterly; agents can spot-check it any time._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli opt-out-violations --since 90d --json --select to,opt_out_at,subsequent_send_at,message_sid
  ```
- **`error-code-explain`** — Top error codes from your recent messages and calls, with curated one-line explanations and fixes for the most common Twilio errors.

  _Every Twilio user Googles error codes. Bundling the explanation with the count removes a constant context-switch._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli error-code-explain --since 7d --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`sync-status`** — Last sync timestamp and row count per resource in the local store — so you know how fresh every other analytic command is.

  _Without freshness UX every analytic command is suspect. One read tells the agent whether to call sync first._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli sync-status --json
  ```
- **`tail-messages`** — Stream new messages with a status filter as they happen — twilio-pp-cli's --follow that twilio-cli does not ship.

  _Incident triage and on-call response need a live feed of failures, not a polling shell loop. One command, no daemon._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli tail-messages --status failed --follow
  ```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
twilio-pp-cli 2010-04-01 create-account

# JSON for scripting and agents
twilio-pp-cli 2010-04-01 create-account --json

# Filter to specific fields
twilio-pp-cli 2010-04-01 create-account --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
twilio-pp-cli 2010-04-01 create-account --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
twilio-pp-cli 2010-04-01 create-account --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/twilio-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | per_call | Yes | Twilio Account SID (starts with AC). Required because the URL path includes it. |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | per_call | No | Master Auth Token. Set this OR both TWILIO_API_KEY_SID and TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET. |
| `TWILIO_API_KEY_SID` | per_call | No | Scoped API Key SID (starts with SK). Pair with TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET. |
| `TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET` | per_call | No | Scoped API Key Secret. Pair with TWILIO_API_KEY_SID. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `twilio-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID && echo $TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 Authenticate (code 20003)** — Run `twilio-pp-cli doctor`. Common causes: scoped API Key bound to a different account than the one in TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, or a rotated Auth Token in the secondary slot.
- **Some commands return empty for a fresh install** — Run `twilio-pp-cli sync --full` once before the analytic commands. Then `twilio-pp-cli sync-status --json` confirms freshness per resource.
- **429 Too Many Requests during sync** — Twilio's default rate limit is ~100 req/s. Reduce parallelism with `--concurrency 4`, or open a support ticket to raise the cap.
- **Subaccount commands fail with 401** — Scoped API Keys can only operate on the account that minted them. Create a master Auth Token credential or call against the subaccount's own SK key. `twilio-pp-cli doctor` flags this.
- **Searching Body returns nothing for known content** — FTS reads the local store. Re-run `twilio-pp-cli sync --resources messages` to refresh. The `\\b` boundary regex in queries needs a doubled backslash on shells that interpret the single one.
