// Package mcp exposes airframe's CLI surface as MCP tools.
//
// airframe has no upstream REST API, so unlike sec-edgar (which pre-registers
// typed tools per endpoint), every tool here is a shell-out to the companion
// `airframe-pp-cli` binary. The cobratree walker (generator-owned, copied
// verbatim from the press's emitted template) auto-registers every Cobra
// command as an MCP tool with sensible safety hints.
//
// A single hand-authored `context` tool front-loads airframe's domain model
// (the two-tier sync, the flight-goat composition, the 72-hour caveat) so
// agents can call it first and reason about which tier they need before
// invoking any of the data tools.
