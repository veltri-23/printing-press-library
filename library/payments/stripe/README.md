# Stripe CLI

**Every Stripe feature, plus a local SQLite mirror with FTS, cross-entity SQL, and analytics no other Stripe tool ships.**

stripe-pp-cli matches the official stripe-cli verb-for-verb and adds what it deliberately omits: a local mirror of customers, subscriptions, invoices, charges, payouts, and events with FTS5 search; cross-entity SQL queries (`sql`); and dossier commands (`health`, `dunning-queue`, `customer-360`, `subs-at-risk`, `payout-reconcile`). Built for agents — every command is one-shot, one-shot, and emits structured output.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `stripe-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-stripe` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install stripe
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install stripe --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install stripe --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install stripe --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install stripe --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/stripe/cmd/stripe-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/stripe-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install stripe --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-stripe --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-stripe --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install stripe --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/stripe-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/stripe/cmd/stripe-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stripe": {
      "command": "stripe-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Authenticate by exporting `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...` (recommended) or running `stripe-pp-cli auth set-token <key>` to persist it. Test-mode keys (`sk_test_...`) and live-mode keys (`sk_live_...`) are accepted. Mutating commands against a live key are blocked by default; pass `--confirm-live` (or set `STRIPE_CONFIRM_LIVE=1`) once you have audited the invocation.

## Known Gaps (v1)

These are deferred to v0.2:

- **Stripe Issuing full workflow** — endpoint passthrough only; spending controls / dispute evidence not built
- **Stripe Terminal** — endpoint passthrough only; in-person SDK pairing out of scope
- **Stripe Tax registration** — `tax-rates` CRUD only; jurisdiction registration not built
- **Connect account fan-out** — single-account at a time; multi-account loops via external script
- **localstripe mock server** — out of scope; use [stripe-mock](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mock) via `STRIPE_BASE_URL`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Persist your test-mode key (or just `export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...`)
stripe-pp-cli auth set-token sk_test_<your-key>

# Pull customers, subscriptions, invoices, charges, payouts, and events into local SQLite
stripe-pp-cli sync --since 30d

# Score every customer; surface the worst 20 — feed into outreach segments
stripe-pp-cli health --all --limit 20 --json

# Surface the failed-payment retry queue ranked by days-overdue
stripe-pp-cli dunning-queue --owner billing@yourcompany.com --json

# Full customer dossier in one shot — replaces 6+ dashboard clicks
stripe-pp-cli customer-360 alice@example.com --compact

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`health`** — Compute a 0-100 health score for one or many customers from local SQLite, factoring in failed-payment count, dispute history, MRR contribution, subscription status, and account age.

  _Use this to feed customer-health signals into outreach, dunning, and renewal automation without burning hundreds of API calls per customer._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli health cus_xyz --json --select score,failed_payments,mrr_contribution
  ```
- **`dunning-queue`** — List invoices in past_due/uncollectible state ranked by days-overdue, with last failure reason and customer email pulled from the local store.

  _When deciding which customers to follow up with about failed payments, this beats walking the Stripe dashboard or chaining 4+ API calls per row._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli dunning-queue --json --select invoice,customer_email,days_overdue,last_failure_reason
  ```
- **`sql`** — Run read-only SQLite queries against the local Stripe mirror. All synced data lives in a generic 'resources' table — query with json_extract(data, '$.field') and filter by resource_type.

  _When a one-off question doesn't fit the canned commands, drop into SQL instead of writing a script that hits the API a thousand times._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli sql "SELECT json_extract(data,'$.email') AS email, COUNT(*) AS active_subs FROM resources WHERE resource_type='subscriptions' AND json_extract(data,'$.status')='active' GROUP BY json_extract(data,'$.customer') HAVING active_subs > 1" --json
  ```
- **`payout-reconcile`** — Join payouts to balance_transactions to charges to customers from local store; flag missing balance_transactions and mismatches; CSV export.

  _Use this for end-of-period payout reconciliation against bank statements or accounting systems — replaces the manual CSV-pivot ritual._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli payout-reconcile --since 7d --csv
  ```
- **`subs-at-risk`** — List subscriptions whose default payment method's card expires in a window, sorted by current MRR contribution.

  _Use this monthly to proactively email customers whose card is about to expire — prevents involuntary churn._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli subs-at-risk --within 30d --json --select customer_email,mrr,card_exp
  ```
- **`metadata-grep`** — Search every synced resource's metadata bag for a key/value across resource types; returns (resource_type, id, matched_kv) rows.

  _When integrating Stripe with a CRM via metadata tags, this finds every related resource in one query._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli metadata-grep 'crm_id=acme-001' --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`customer-360`** — One-shot dossier: customer profile + active subs + recent invoices + payment methods + recent charges + open disputes + lifetime spend.

  _Use this as the first command when investigating a customer ticket, support escalation, or churn risk — full context in one call._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli customer-360 alice@example.com --json --compact
  ```
- **`events-since`** — Fetch all Events since a cursor, persist new cursor in profile, no daemon. One-shot replacement for stripe-cli's listen daemon.

  _Use this in cron-driven agent loops to replay only new events since the last run — no daemon to babysit, no missed events._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli events-since --type 'invoice.*' --json --select id,type,created,data.object.id
  ```

If you set an <code>amount_off</code>, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>100</currency> will have a final total of <currency>0</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>300</currency> will have a final total of <currency>100</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it.</p>

- **`stripe-pp-cli credit-notes post`** - <p>Issue a credit note to adjust the amount of a finalized invoice. A credit note will first reduce the invoice’s <code>amount_remaining</code> (and <code>amount_due</code>), but not below zero.
This amount is indicated by the credit note’s <code>pre_payment_amount</code>. The excess amount is indicated by <code>post_payment_amount</code>, and it can result in any combination of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refunds: create a new refund (using <code>refund_amount</code>) or link existing refunds (using <code>refunds</code>).</li>
<li>Customer balance credit: credit the customer’s balance (using <code>credit_amount</code>) which will be automatically applied to their next invoice when it’s finalized.</li>
<li>Outside of Stripe credit: record the amount that is or will be credited outside of Stripe (using <code>out_of_band_amount</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The sum of refunds, customer balance credits, and outside of Stripe credits must equal the <code>post_payment_amount</code>.</p>

<p>You may issue multiple credit notes for an invoice. Each credit note may increment the invoice’s <code>pre_payment_credit_notes_amount</code>,
<code>post_payment_credit_notes_amount</code>, or both, depending on the invoice’s <code>amount_remaining</code> at the time of credit note creation.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli credit-notes post-id`** - <p>Updates an existing credit note.</p>

- **`stripe-pp-cli customers post`** - <p>Creates a new customer object.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli customers post-customer`** - <p>Updates the specified customer by setting the values of the parameters passed. Any parameters not provided are left unchanged. For example, if you pass the <strong>source</strong> parameter, that becomes the customer’s active source (such as a card) to be used for all charges in the future. When you update a customer to a new valid card source by passing the <strong>source</strong> parameter: for each of the customer’s current subscriptions, if the subscription bills automatically and is in the <code>past_due</code> state, then the latest open invoice for the subscription with automatic collection enabled is retried. This retry doesn’t count as an automatic retry, and doesn’t affect the next regularly scheduled payment for the invoice. Changing the <strong>default_source</strong> for a customer doesn’t trigger this behavior.</p>

<p>This request accepts mostly the same arguments as the customer creation call.</p>

<a href="/docs/identity/how-sessions-work">status</a>. Redacting a VerificationSession in <code>requires_action</code>
state will automatically cancel it.</p>

<p>The redaction process may take up to four days. When the redaction process is in progress, the
VerificationSession’s <code>redaction.status</code> field will be set to <code>processing</code>; when the process is
finished, it will change to <code>redacted</code> and an <code>identity.verification_session.redacted</code> event
will be emitted.</p>

<p>Redaction is irreversible. Redacted objects are still accessible in the Stripe API, but all the
fields that contain personal data will be replaced by the string <code>[redacted]</code> or a similar
placeholder. The <code>metadata</code> field will also be erased. Redacted objects cannot be updated or
used for any purpose.</p>

Attempts to delete invoices that are no longer in a draft state will fail; once an invoice has been finalized or if an invoice is for a subscription, it must be <a href="/api/invoices/void">voided</a>.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli invoices get`** - <p>You can list all invoices, or list the invoices for a specific customer. The invoices are returned sorted by creation date, with the most recently created invoices appearing first.</p>

conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally, propagation of new or updated data can be up
to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available to merchants in India.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli invoices post`** - <p>This endpoint creates a draft invoice for a given customer. The invoice remains a draft until you <a href="/api/invoices/finalize">finalize</a> the invoice, which allows you to <a href="/api/invoices/pay">pay</a> or <a href="/api/invoices/send">send</a> the invoice to your customers.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli invoices post-create-preview`** - <p>At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a subscription or subscription schedule.

<p>You can also preview the effects of creating or updating a subscription or subscription schedule, including a preview of any prorations that will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass the <code>subscription_details.proration_date</code> parameter when doing the actual subscription update.</p>

<p>The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed on the invoice is to consider line items where <code>parent.subscription_item_details.proration</code> is <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply viewing a preview – the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>

<p>Note: Currency conversion calculations use the latest exchange rates. Exchange rates may vary between the time of the preview and the time of the actual invoice creation. <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions">Learn more</a></p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli invoices post-invoice`** - <p>Draft invoices are fully editable. Once an invoice is <a href="/docs/billing/invoices/workflow#finalized">finalized</a>,
monetary values, as well as <code>collection_method</code>, become uneditable.</p>

<p>If you would like to stop the Stripe Billing engine from automatically finalizing, reattempting payments on,
sending reminders for, or <a href="/docs/billing/invoices/reconciliation">automatically reconciling</a> invoices, pass
<code>auto_advance=false</code>.</p>

### subscriptions

Manage subscriptions

- **`stripe-pp-cli subscriptions delete-exposed-id`** - <p>Cancels a customer’s subscription immediately. The customer won’t be charged again for the subscription. After it’s canceled, you can no longer update the subscription or its <a href="/metadata">metadata</a>.</p>

<p>Any pending invoice items that you’ve created are still charged at the end of the period, unless manually <a href="/api/invoiceitems/delete">deleted</a>. If you’ve set the subscription to cancel at the end of the period, any pending prorations are also left in place and collected at the end of the period. But if the subscription is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations are removed if <code>invoice_now</code> and <code>prorate</code> are both set to true.</p>

<p>By default, upon subscription cancellation, Stripe stops automatic collection of all finalized invoices for the customer. This is intended to prevent unexpected payment attempts after the customer has canceled a subscription. However, you can resume automatic collection of the invoices manually after subscription cancellation to have us proceed. Or, you could check for unpaid invoices before allowing the customer to cancel the subscription at all.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli subscriptions get`** - <p>By default, returns a list of subscriptions that have not been canceled. In order to list canceled subscriptions, specify <code>status=canceled</code>.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli subscriptions get-exposed-id`** - <p>Retrieves the subscription with the given ID.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli subscriptions get-search`** - <p>Search for subscriptions you’ve previously created using Stripe’s <a href="/docs/search#search-query-language">Search Query Language</a>.
Don’t use search in read-after-write flows where strict consistency is necessary. Under normal operating
conditions, data is searchable in less than a minute. Occasionally, propagation of new or updated data can be up
to an hour behind during outages. Search functionality is not available to merchants in India.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli subscriptions post`** - <p>Creates a new subscription on an existing customer. Each customer can have up to 500 active or scheduled subscriptions.</p>

<p>When you create a subscription with <code>collection_method=charge_automatically</code>, the first invoice is finalized as part of the request.
The <code>payment_behavior</code> parameter determines the exact behavior of the initial payment.</p>

<p>To start subscriptions where the first invoice always begins in a <code>draft</code> status, use <a href="/docs/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules#managing">subscription schedules</a> instead.
Schedules provide the flexibility to model more complex billing configurations that change over time.</p>
- **`stripe-pp-cli subscriptions post-exposed-id`** - <p>Updates an existing subscription to match the specified parameters.
When changing prices or quantities, we optionally prorate the price we charge next month to make up for any price changes.
To preview how the proration is calculated, use the <a href="/docs/api/invoices/create_preview">create preview</a> endpoint.</p>

<p>By default, we prorate subscription changes. For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a <currency>100</currency> price, they’ll be billed <currency>100</currency> immediately. If on May 15 they switch to a <currency>200</currency> price, then on June 1 they’ll be billed <currency>250</currency> (<currency>200</currency> for a renewal of her subscription, plus a <currency>50</currency> prorating adjustment for half of the previous month’s <currency>100</currency> difference). Similarly, a downgrade generates a credit that is applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes.</p>

<p>Switching prices does not normally change the billing date or generate an immediate charge unless:</p>

<ul>
<li>The billing interval is changed (for example, from monthly to yearly).</li>
<li>The subscription moves from free to paid.</li>
<li>A trial starts or ends.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, we apply a credit for the unused time on the previous price, immediately charge the customer using the new price, and reset the billing date. Learn about how <a href="/docs/billing/subscriptions/upgrade-downgrade#immediate-payment">Stripe immediately attempts payment for subscription changes</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to charge for an upgrade immediately, pass <code>proration_behavior</code> as <code>always_invoice</code> to create prorations, automatically invoice the customer for those proration adjustments, and attempt to collect payment. If you pass <code>create_prorations</code>, the prorations are created but not automatically invoiced. If you want to bill the customer for the prorations before the subscription’s renewal date, you need to manually <a href="/docs/api/invoices/create">invoice the customer</a>.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to prorate, set the <code>proration_behavior</code> option to <code>none</code>. With this option, the customer is billed <currency>100</currency> on May 1 and <currency>200</currency> on June 1. Similarly, if you set <code>proration_behavior</code> to <code>none</code> when switching between different billing intervals (for example, from monthly to yearly), we don’t generate any credits for the old subscription’s unused time. We still reset the billing date and bill immediately for the new subscription.</p>

<p>Updating the quantity on a subscription many times in an hour may result in <a href="/docs/rate-limits">rate limiting</a>. If you need to bill for a frequently changing quantity, consider integrating <a href="/docs/billing/subscriptions/usage-based">usage-based billing</a> instead.</p>

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
stripe-pp-cli account

# JSON for scripting and agents
stripe-pp-cli account --json

# Filter to specific fields
stripe-pp-cli account --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
stripe-pp-cli account --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
stripe-pp-cli account --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
stripe-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/stripe-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `stripe-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **Auth errors after `auth login` succeeded** — Check active profile with `stripe-pp-cli auth status`; switch with `stripe-pp-cli profile use <name>`
- **Rate limit (429) errors on sync** — Test-mode caps at 25 r/s; sync auto-throttles, but reduce `--page-size` if hitting it persistently
- **`sql` command shows empty tables** — Run `stripe-pp-cli sync --full` — local store starts empty until first sync
- **Live-mode key detected** — v1 of stripe-pp-cli does not enforce a live-mode write guard. Audit every command before running with sk_live_... ; prefer sk_test_... for development.
