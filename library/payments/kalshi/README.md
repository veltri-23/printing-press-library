# Kalshi CLI

**Trade prediction markets, persist tick data, and answer category-level P&L questions Kalshi.com cannot.**

Every Kalshi feature, plus a local SQLite store that records market prices on every sync — so movers, correlations, and price history work offline. Honest about read-only vs read/write keys, with --dry-run on every mutator and a global --read-only safe-mode lock for newsroom and bot deployments.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `kalshi-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-kalshi` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install kalshi
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install kalshi --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install kalshi --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install kalshi --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install kalshi --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/kalshi/cmd/kalshi-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/kalshi-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install kalshi --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-kalshi --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-kalshi --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install kalshi --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/kalshi-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `KALSHI_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/kalshi/cmd/kalshi-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kalshi": {
      "command": "kalshi-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "KALSHI_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>


## Authentication

Kalshi requires composed RSA-PSS signature auth: a UUID access key id (KALSHI_API_KEY) plus an RSA private key file (KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH or KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY). Kalshi issues two key tiers — read-only and read/write — and the CLI honors KALSHI_READ_ONLY=1 (or --read-only) as a client-side lock that blocks every POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE before signing, regardless of which tier is loaded. Write commands run against a read-only key will surface a 403 from Kalshi; pair with --dry-run while debugging.

## Quick Start

```bash
# verify your key id + private key are loaded; reports configured/source
kalshi-pp-cli auth status

# populate the local SQLite store including the market_price_history snapshot table
kalshi-pp-cli sync

# browse open markets from the live API (sync first for offline filtering)
kalshi-pp-cli markets get --status open --limit 10 --json

# render the captured price history with an inline sparkline (requires ≥2 syncs)
kalshi-pp-cli markets history KXPRES-2028-DJT --sparkline

# compute realized P&L grouped by Kalshi category
kalshi-pp-cli portfolio attribution --by category --since 2026-01-01 --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`portfolio attribution`** — See your realized P&L broken down by market category and series over any time window — answer 'did politics actually make money this quarter?' in one command.

  _Use when an agent needs realized P&L sliced by Kalshi taxonomy — the API returns flat fills and settlements; this command joins them with the category metadata required to attribute correctly._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli portfolio attribution --since 2026-01-01 --by category --json
  ```
- **`markets history`** — Show how a market's yes/no price moved over time, with a sparkline rendering — built from snapshots captured by every markets sync.

  _Use when an agent asks 'how did this market move' or needs price-over-time for backtesting; the API only returns current price._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli markets history KXPRES-2028-DJT --since 2026-04-01 --sparkline
  ```
- **`portfolio winrate`** — Calculate your win/loss ratio, expected value, and ROI across all settled positions, optionally sliced by category.

  _Use when an agent evaluates trading-strategy performance; no Kalshi tool computes this._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli portfolio winrate --category sports --since 2026-01-01 --json
  ```
- **`portfolio calendar`** — See upcoming settlements with your positions, expected payouts, and category breakdown over the next N days.

  _Use when an agent needs to plan around upcoming settlements; the API surfaces positions and event expiries on different endpoints._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli portfolio calendar --days 14
  ```
- **`markets movers`** — Find markets with the biggest price swings since the last sync — sorted by absolute delta or by volume change.

  _Use when an agent needs to surface notable market activity; the API has no 'recent movers' endpoint._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli markets movers --window 24h --category politics --json
  ```
- **`markets correlate`** — Compute Pearson correlation of two markets' price histories — find correlated events for hedging or signal discovery.

  _Use when an agent investigates cross-market relationships; no API endpoint or other tool computes correlation across Kalshi markets._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli markets correlate KXFEDFUNDS-26FEB KXCPI-26FEB --window 30d --json
  ```
- **`portfolio exposure`** — Break down total exposure by category with concentration warnings when any bucket exceeds a configurable risk threshold.

  _Use when an agent needs portfolio-level risk; the API doesn't aggregate exposure by Kalshi taxonomy._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli portfolio exposure --by category --warn-threshold 0.4 --json
  ```
- **`watch diff`** — Maintain a local watchlist of tickers; `watch diff` shows price/volume change vs the last sync per watched market — Riley's daily-snapshot ritual reduced to one command.

  _Use when an agent tracks a stable set of markets across runs; the API has no watchlist concept._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli watch diff --since 24h
  ```

### Honest auth
- **`--read-only`** — Global env-var/flag lock that blocks every mutating command client-side regardless of which key tier is loaded — pair with --dry-run on every mutator for safe scripting against read-only credentials.

  _Use when an agent runs against an unknown Kalshi key tier — the read-only key tier exists and mid-script 403s are common; this surfaces the constraint client-side before the API is hit._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli --read-only portfolio create-order --ticker KXTEST --side yes --count 1 --yes-price 50 --dry-run
  ```
- **`subaccounts rollup`** — Aggregate positions, fills-today, balance, and exposure-by-category across every subaccount you can see — household view of risk and resting orders.

  _Use when an FCM-tier user needs aggregate risk across subaccounts; no Kalshi tool surfaces a household view._

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli subaccounts rollup --by category --json
  ```

- **`kalshi-pp-cli markets get-orderbooks`** - Endpoint for getting the current order books for multiple markets in a single request. The order book shows all active bid orders for both yes and no sides of a binary market. It returns yes bids and no bids only (no asks are returned). This is because in binary markets, a bid for yes at price X is equivalent to an ask for no at price (100-X). For example, a yes bid at 7¢ is the same as a no ask at 93¢, with identical contract sizes. Each side shows price levels with their corresponding quantities and order counts, organized from best to worst prices. Returns one orderbook per requested market ticker.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli markets get-ticker`** - Endpoint for getting data about a specific market by its ticker. A market represents a specific binary outcome within an event that users can trade on (e.g., "Will candidate X win?"). Markets have yes/no positions, current prices, volume, and settlement rules.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli markets get-trades`** - Endpoint for getting all trades for all markets. A trade represents a completed transaction between two users on a specific market. Each trade includes the market ticker, price, quantity, and timestamp information. This endpoint returns a paginated response. Use the 'limit' parameter to control page size (1-1000, defaults to 100). The response includes a 'cursor' field - pass this value in the 'cursor' parameter of your next request to get the next page. An empty cursor indicates no more pages are available.

### milestones

Milestone endpoints

- **`kalshi-pp-cli milestones get`** - Minimum start date to filter milestones. Format: RFC3339 timestamp
- **`kalshi-pp-cli milestones get-milestoneid`** - Endpoint for getting data about a specific milestone by its ID.

### multivariate-event-collections

Manage multivariate event collections

- **`kalshi-pp-cli multivariate-event-collections create-market-in`** - Endpoint for creating an individual market in a multivariate event collection. This endpoint must be hit at least once before trading or looking up a market. Users are limited to 5000 creations per week.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli multivariate-event-collections get`** - Endpoint for getting data about multivariate event collections.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli multivariate-event-collections get-multivariateeventcollections`** - Endpoint for getting data about a multivariate event collection by its ticker.

### portfolio

Portfolio and balance information endpoints

- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio amend-order`** - Endpoint for amending the max number of fillable contracts and/or price in an existing order. Max fillable contracts is `remaining_count` + `fill_count`.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio amend-order-v2`** - Endpoint for amending the price and/or remaining count of an existing event-market order using the V2 request/response shape.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio apply-subaccount-transfer`** - Transfers funds between the authenticated user's subaccounts. Use 0 for the primary account, or 1-32 for numbered subaccounts.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio batch-cancel-orders`** - Endpoint for cancelling a batch of orders. The maximum batch size scales with your tier's write budget — see [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits).
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio batch-cancel-orders-v2`** - Endpoint for cancelling a batch of event-market orders using the V2 response shape. The maximum batch size scales with your tier's write budget — see [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits).
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio batch-create-orders`** - Endpoint for submitting a batch of orders. The maximum batch size scales with your tier's write budget — see [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits).
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio batch-create-orders-v2`** - Endpoint for submitting a batch of event-market orders using the V2 request/response shape. The maximum batch size scales with your tier's write budget — see [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits).
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio cancel-order`** - Endpoint for canceling orders. The value for the orderId should match the id field of the order you want to decrease. Commonly, DELETE-type endpoints return 204 status with no body content on success. But we can't completely delete the order, as it may be partially filled already. Instead, the DeleteOrder endpoint reduce the order completely, essentially zeroing the remaining resting contracts on it. The zeroed order is returned on the response payload as a form of validation for the client.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio cancel-order-v2`** - Endpoint for cancelling event-market orders using the V2 response shape. Returns `{order_id, client_order_id, reduced_by}` rather than a full order object.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio create-order`** - Endpoint for submitting orders in a market. Each user is limited to 200 000 open orders at a time.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio create-order-group`** - Creates a new order group with a contracts limit measured over a rolling 15-second window. When the limit is hit, all orders in the group are cancelled and no new orders can be placed until reset.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio create-order-v2`** - Endpoint for submitting event-market orders using the V2 request/response shape (single-book `bid`/`ask` side and fixed-point dollar prices). The legacy `/portfolio/orders` endpoint will be deprecated no earlier than May 6, 2026 — clients should migrate to this path.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio create-subaccount`** - Creates a new subaccount for the authenticated user. Subaccounts are numbered sequentially starting from 1. Maximum 32 subaccounts per user.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio decrease-order`** - Endpoint for decreasing the number of contracts in an existing order. This is the only kind of edit available on order quantity. Cancelling an order is equivalent to decreasing an order amount to zero.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio decrease-order-v2`** - Endpoint for decreasing the remaining count of an existing event-market order using the V2 request/response shape. Only `reduce_to` is supported.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio delete-order-group`** - Deletes an order group and cancels all orders within it. This permanently removes the group.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-balance`** - Endpoint for getting the balance and portfolio value of a member. Both values are returned in cents.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-fills`** - Endpoint for getting all fills for the member. A fill is when a trade you have is matched.
Fills that occurred before the historical cutoff are only available via `GET /historical/fills`. See [Historical Data](https://kalshi.com/docs/getting_started/historical_data) for details.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-order`** - Endpoint for getting a single order.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-order-group`** - Retrieves details for a single order group including all order IDs and auto-cancel status.

- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-order-queue-position`** - Endpoint for getting an order's queue position in the order book. This represents the amount of orders that need to be matched before this order receives a partial or full match. Queue position is determined using a price-time priority.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-order-queue-positions`** - Endpoint for getting queue positions for all resting orders. Queue position represents the number of contracts that need to be matched before an order receives a partial or full match, determined using price-time priority.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-orders`** - Restricts the response to orders that have a certain status: resting, canceled, or executed.
Orders that have been canceled or fully executed before the historical cutoff are only available via `GET /historical/orders`. Resting orders will always be available through this endpoint. See [Historical Data](https://kalshi.com/docs/getting_started/historical_data) for details.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-positions`** - Restricts the positions to those with any of following fields with non-zero values, as a comma separated list. The following values are accepted: position, total_traded
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-resting-order-total-value`** - Endpoint for getting the total value, in cents, of resting orders. This endpoint is only intended for use by FCM members (rare). Note: If you're uncertain about this endpoint, it likely does not apply to you.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-settlements`** - Endpoint for getting the member's settlements historical track.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio get-subaccount-balances`** - Gets balances for all subaccounts including the primary account.

- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio trigger-order-group`** - Triggers the order group, canceling all orders in the group and preventing new orders until the group is reset.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio update-order-group-limit`** - Updates the order group contracts limit (rolling 15-second window). If the updated limit would immediately trigger the group, all orders in the group are canceled and the group is triggered.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli portfolio update-subaccount-netting`** - Updates the netting enabled setting for a specific subaccount. Use 0 for the primary account, or 1-32 for numbered subaccounts.

### series

Manage series

- **`kalshi-pp-cli series get`** - Endpoint for getting data about a specific series by its ticker.  A series represents a template for recurring events that follow the same format and rules (e.g., "Monthly Jobs Report", "Weekly Initial Jobless Claims", "Daily Weather in NYC"). Series define the structure, settlement sources, and metadata that will be applied to each recurring event instance within that series.
- **`kalshi-pp-cli series get-fee-changes`** - Get Series Fee Changes
- **`kalshi-pp-cli series get-list`** - Endpoint for getting data about multiple series with specified filters.  A series represents a template for recurring events that follow the same format and rules (e.g., "Monthly Jobs Report", "Weekly Initial Jobless Claims", "Daily Weather in NYC"). This endpoint allows you to browse and discover available series templates by category.

### structured-targets

Structured targets endpoints

# Dry run — show the request without sending
kalshi-pp-cli api-keys get --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
kalshi-pp-cli api-keys get --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Retryable** - creates return "already exists" on retry, deletes return "already deleted"
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/kalshi-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:
- `KALSHI_API_KEY`

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `kalshi-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $KALSHI_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items


### API-specific
- **doctor reports `auth_status: missing private key`** — export KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=~/.kalshi/private_key.pem (RSA PEM from Kalshi.com → Account → API Keys)
- **Loaded a read-only key but want to script safely** — export KALSHI_READ_ONLY=1 (or pass --read-only) — the client blocks every POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE before signing
- **portfolio create-order returns 403 Permission Denied** — your loaded API key is read-only. Issue a read/write key from Kalshi → Account → API Keys, or run write commands with --dry-run while debugging
- **markets movers returns no rows or no movement** — run kalshi-pp-cli sync at least twice an hour apart — movers reads from market_price_history snapshots
- **rate-limit errors during sync** — run kalshi-pp-cli account get-api-limits --json to inspect your tier; lower sync parallelism with kalshi-pp-cli sync --concurrency 2

## Known Gaps

These are documented limitations that ship with this version. They do not affect day-to-day use; they only surface in synthetic test environments.

- **Sync warnings on bare-path resources.** A handful of resource paths (e.g., `/account`, `/api-keys`, `/communications`) emit HTTP 404 warnings during `sync` because Kalshi exposes them under nested paths (e.g., `/portfolio/account`). Sync correctly skips them and continues with usable resources (markets, events, series, milestones, incentive-programs). This is a generator-level naming gap; the affected commands work normally when called directly.
- **Write-side endpoint mirrors require valid bodies.** Commands like `api-keys create`, `communications create-quote`, `portfolio batch-create-orders`, `portfolio apply-subaccount-transfer` need valid Kalshi-domain request bodies (real market tickers, valid pricing, etc.). Calling them with placeholder values returns Kalshi's HTTP 400/404. This is expected — these endpoints work when given real input.
- **Auth tier detection is client-side only.** The CLI does not actively probe whether your loaded API key is read-only or read/write. Use `KALSHI_READ_ONLY=1` or `--read-only` to enforce a client-side lock; the API will return 403 on writes if your key tier is read-only.
- **Resource name pollution.** Two paths (`/search/filters_by_sport` and `/search/tags_by_categories`) collided with the framework `search` command and were renamed to `kalshi-trade-manual-search` and `kalshi-trade-manual-search-2`. These are intentionally ugly to surface the collision.
