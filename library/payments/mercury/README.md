## Install

The recommended path installs both the `mercury-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-mercury` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install mercury
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install mercury --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install mercury --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install mercury --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install mercury --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.5 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/mercury/cmd/mercury-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/mercury-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install mercury --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-mercury --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-mercury --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install mercury --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/mercury-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `MERCURY_BEARER_AUTH` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/mercury/cmd/mercury-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mercury": {
      "command": "mercury-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "MERCURY_BEARER_AUTH": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Set Up Credentials

Get your access token from your API provider's developer portal, then store it:

```bash
mercury-pp-cli auth set-token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Or set it via environment variable:

```bash
export MERCURY_BEARER_AUTH="your-token-here"
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
mercury-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration and credentials.

### 4. Try Your First Command

```bash
mercury-pp-cli account mock-value
```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

- **`workflow payment-plan`** — Builds a read-only approval plan with body, idempotency key, dry-run command, and execute command before payment or transfer writes.

  _Agents can prepare exact write commands without moving money._

  ```bash
  mercury-pp-cli workflow payment-plan --kind transfer --source-account-id acct_src --destination-account-id acct_dst --amount 25 --agent
  ```
- **`workflow archive`** — Syncs supported Mercury resources into a local SQLite store for offline search and analytics.

  _Reduces API calls and gives agents repeatable context._

  ```bash
  mercury-pp-cli workflow archive --agent
  ```
- **`agent-context`** — Emits machine-readable command metadata for agents and MCP hosts.

  _Improves autonomous command selection and reduces context waste._

  ```bash
  mercury-pp-cli agent-context --agent
  ```

# Dry run — show the request without sending
mercury-pp-cli account mock-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
mercury-pp-cli account mock-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
mercury-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/mercury-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MERCURY_BEARER_AUTH` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `mercury-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $MERCURY_BEARER_AUTH`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items
