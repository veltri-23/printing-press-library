# Beehiiv CLI

Created by [@kjmagnan1s](https://github.com/kjmagnan1s) (Kevin Magnan).

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `beehiiv-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-beehiiv` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install beehiiv
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install beehiiv --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install beehiiv --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install beehiiv --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install beehiiv --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/marketing/beehiiv/cmd/beehiiv-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/beehiiv-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install beehiiv --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-beehiiv --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-beehiiv --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install beehiiv --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/beehiiv-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `BEEHIIV_BEARER_AUTH` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "beehiiv": {
      "command": "beehiiv-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "BEEHIIV_BEARER_AUTH": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Set Up Credentials

Get your access token from your API provider's developer portal, then store it:

```bash
beehiiv-pp-cli auth set-token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Or set it via environment variable:

```bash
export BEEHIIV_BEARER_AUTH="your-token-here"
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
beehiiv-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration and credentials.

### 4. Try Your First Command

```bash
beehiiv-pp-cli advertisement-opportunities mock-value
```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Publication intelligence
- **`insights growth-summary`** — Summarize publication, subscriber, post, referral, and custom-field health in one read-only response.

  _Use this first when an agent needs a compact account-level picture before choosing a narrower Beehiiv endpoint._

  ```bash
  beehiiv-pp-cli insights growth-summary pub_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --agent
  ```
- **`insights post-performance`** — List recent posts with status, audience, publish timing, and any available expanded stats.

  _Use this when an agent needs to inspect content output before drilling into one post._

  ```bash
  beehiiv-pp-cli insights post-performance pub_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --limit 25 --agent
  ```

### Audience intelligence
- **`insights subscriber-sources`** — Group subscribers by UTM, channel, and referring-site fields to see where audience growth is coming from.

  _Use this when the question is about acquisition channels rather than individual subscribers._

  ```bash
  beehiiv-pp-cli insights subscriber-sources pub_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --limit 100 --agent
  ```
- **`insights field-coverage`** — Inspect custom-field definitions alongside subscriber sample size for enrichment planning.

  _Use this before importing, enriching, or auditing subscriber metadata._

  ```bash
  beehiiv-pp-cli insights field-coverage pub_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --agent
  ```
- **`insights subscriber-lookup`** — Find one subscriber by email or subscription ID and return a compact subscriber record.

  _Use this when the task is about one subscriber and broad list calls would waste context._

  ```bash
  beehiiv-pp-cli insights subscriber-lookup pub_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --email reader@example.com --agent
  ```

### Growth loops
- **`insights referral-health`** — Summarize referral-program configuration and subscriber referral-code coverage.

  _Use this when an agent needs to check whether referral growth is configured and visible in subscriber data._

  ```bash
  beehiiv-pp-cli insights referral-health pub_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --agent
  ```

</Note>
Create a post for a specific publication. For a detailed walkthrough including setup, testing workflows, and working with custom HTML and templates, see the <a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/support/article/36759164012439-using-the-send-api-and-create-post-endpoint">Using the Send API and Create Post Endpoint</a> guide.

## Content methods

There are three ways to provide content for a post. You must provide either `blocks` or `body_content`, but not both.

### 1. Blocks

Use the `blocks` field to build your post with structured content blocks such as paragraphs, images, headings, buttons, tables, and more. Each block has a `type` and its own set of properties. This method gives you fine-grained control over individual content elements and supports features like visual settings, visibility settings, and dynamic content targeting.

### 2. Raw HTML (`body_content`)

Use the `body_content` field to provide a single string of raw HTML. The HTML is wrapped in an `htmlSnippet` block internally. This is useful when you have pre-built HTML content or are migrating from another platform.

### 3. HTML blocks within blocks

Use `type: html` blocks inside the `blocks` array to embed raw HTML snippets alongside other structured blocks. This lets you mix structured content (paragraphs, images, etc.) with custom HTML where needed.

## CSS and styling guardrails

beehiiv processes all HTML content through a sanitization pipeline. When using `body_content` or `html` blocks, be aware of the following:

- **`<style>` tags are removed.** All `<style>` block elements are stripped during sanitization. Do not rely on embedded stylesheets.
- **`<link>` tags are removed.** External stylesheet references are not allowed.
- **Inline styles are preserved.** Styles applied directly to elements via the `style` attribute (e.g., `<div style="color: red;">`) are kept intact.
- **CSS classes have no effect.** While class attributes are not stripped, no corresponding stylesheets are loaded to apply them.
- **beehiiv's email template wraps your content.** Your HTML is rendered inside beehiiv's email table structure, which applies its own layout and spacing. This may affect the appearance of your content.
- **Use inline styles for all visual styling.** Since `<style>` and `<link>` tags are removed, inline styles on individual elements are the only reliable way to control appearance.
- **`beehiiv-pp-cli posts delete`** - Delete or Archive a post. Any post that has been confirmed will have it's status changed to `archived`. Posts in the `draft` status will be permanently deleted.
- **`beehiiv-pp-cli posts index`** - List posts <Badge intent="info" minimal outlined>OAuth Scope: posts:read</Badge>
- **`beehiiv-pp-cli posts show`** - Get post <Badge intent="info" minimal outlined>OAuth Scope: posts:read</Badge>

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
beehiiv-pp-cli advertisement-opportunities mock-value

# JSON for scripting and agents
beehiiv-pp-cli advertisement-opportunities mock-value --json

# Filter to specific fields
beehiiv-pp-cli advertisement-opportunities mock-value --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
beehiiv-pp-cli advertisement-opportunities mock-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
beehiiv-pp-cli advertisement-opportunities mock-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
beehiiv-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/beehiiv-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BEEHIIV_BEARER_AUTH` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `beehiiv-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $BEEHIIV_BEARER_AUTH`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items
