# Dub CLI

**Every Dub feature, plus offline search, agent-native output, and a local SQLite store no other Dub tool has.**

dub-pp-cli covers all 53 Dub API operations as typed commands, then transcends with cross-resource joins the API cannot answer alone — dead-link detection, drift detection, partner leaderboards from /partners/analytics joined with local commissions, bounty submission triage, and a Monday-morning workspace health report. The official dub-cli covers 6 commands; we cover 67.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `dub-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-dub` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install dub
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install dub --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install dub --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install dub --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install dub --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/marketing/dub/cmd/dub-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/dub-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install dub --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-dub --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-dub --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install dub --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/dub-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `DUB_TOKEN` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/dub/cmd/dub-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dub": {
      "command": "dub-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "DUB_TOKEN": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

dub-pp-cli reads DUB_API_KEY from the environment (Speakeasy convention; DUB_TOKEN also accepted for compatibility with prior community CLIs). The key is workspace-scoped — the workspace is implicit in the key. Get one from dub.co/settings/tokens and run `dub-pp-cli doctor` to verify connectivity.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Verify API key, base URL, and rate-limit headroom.
dub-pp-cli doctor

# Populate the local SQLite store so search and transcendence commands work offline.
dub-pp-cli sync

# List the workspace's links with the fields agents care about.
dub-pp-cli links list --json --select id,key,url,clicks

# Find dormant links — the headline transcendence feature.
dub-pp-cli links stale --days 90 --json

# Cross-resource Monday-morning report: rate-limit headroom, expiring links, bounty triage backlog.
dub-pp-cli health --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`links stale`** — Find archived, expired, or zero-traffic links across the workspace before they pile up.

  _Use this to clean up dormant short links before a portfolio review or before bulk-archiving. The /analytics endpoint can't filter links by 'no clicks in N days' in a single call._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links stale --days 90 --json --select id,key,clicks,archived
  ```
- **`links drift`** — Detect links whose click rate dropped more than threshold percent week-over-week.

  _Catches dying campaigns before reporting deadlines. Use this in a weekly automation to surface attribution links that quietly stopped converting._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links drift --window 7d --threshold 30 --json
  ```
- **`links duplicates`** — Find every link in the workspace pointing to the same destination URL.

  _Surfaces accidental duplicates from bulk-create overruns and consolidation candidates after a migration._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links duplicates --json
  ```
- **`links lint`** — Audit short-key slugs for lookalike collisions, reserved-word violations, and brand-conflict hazards.

  _Use this before a brand campaign launch to catch lookalike slugs that confuse partners or get reserved-word treatment._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links lint --json
  ```
- **`links rollup`** — Performance dashboard aggregated by tag or folder — clicks, leads, sales rolled up across every link wearing each label.

  _Use this to compare campaign performance across tag dimensions without reconciling 5 separate API calls._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links rollup --by clicks --group-by tag --json
  ```
- **`funnel`** — Click-to-lead-to-sale conversion rates per link or campaign.

  _Surfaces where prospects drop off in your attribution funnel. Use before quarterly reporting to spot links with high clicks and low conversion._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli funnel --link mylink --min-clicks 50 --json
  ```
- **`customers journey`** — See every link a customer clicked, when they became a lead, and when they purchased — in one timeline.

  _Use this for QBR-style account reviews or to debug attribution issues for a specific customer._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli customers journey cust_abc123 --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`links rewrite`** — Show every link that would change and the exact patch BEFORE sending.

  _Use this before any campaign-wide rewrite. Diff preview prevents the worst class of bulk-mutation mistakes._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links rewrite --match 'utm_source=oldcampaign' --replace 'utm_source=newcampaign' --dry-run
  ```
- **`health`** — Cross-resource Monday-morning report: rate-limit headroom, expired-but-active links, dead destination URLs, unverified domains, dormant tags, bounty submissions awaiting review.

  _Use this as the first thing every morning, or as a CI canary. Surfaces what needs attention without dashboard hopping._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli health --json
  ```
- **`since`** — What happened in the last N hours? Created, updated, deleted links plus partner approvals, new bounty submissions, and top-clicked entities.

  _Use this in agent loops to summarize workspace activity since the last check-in. Cheap and idempotent._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli since 24h --json
  ```

### Partner ops
- **`partners leaderboard`** — Rank partners by commission earned, conversion rate, and clicks generated.

  _Use this to identify top performers before a partner-tier review, or dormant partners worth deactivating._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli partners leaderboard --by commission --top 10 --json
  ```
- **`partners audit-commissions`** — Reconcile partners, commissions, bounties, and payouts to flag stale rates, missing payouts, and expired bounties still earning.

  _Run this before a payout cycle to catch billing surprises. Use in CI before any commission-rate migration._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli partners audit-commissions --json
  ```
- **`bounties triage`** — Group partner-submitted bounty proof by status, age, and bounty type. Surfaces backlog awaiting review.

  _Run weekly to keep bounty submissions from rotting. Bounty programs lose partner trust when submissions sit unreviewed._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli bounties triage --status pending --older-than 7d --json
  ```
- **`bounties payout-projection`** — Project upcoming payouts from approved-but-unpaid submissions multiplied by current commission rates.

  _Use this for finance/marketing planning. Surfaces upcoming payout liability before the next payout cycle._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli bounties payout-projection --window 30d --json
  ```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
dub-pp-cli commissions list

# JSON for scripting and agents
dub-pp-cli commissions list --json

# Filter to specific fields
dub-pp-cli commissions list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
dub-pp-cli commissions list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
dub-pp-cli commissions list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Retryable** - creates return "already exists" on retry, deletes return "already deleted"
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
dub-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/dub-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:
- `DUB_TOKEN`

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `dub-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $DUB_TOKEN`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 Unauthorized: Invalid API key** — Confirm DUB_API_KEY is set and starts with `dub_`. Tokens from dub.co/settings/tokens are workspace-scoped.
- **429 rate_limit_exceeded on /analytics** — Analytics has tighter per-second caps (Pro 2/s, Advanced 8/s). The client retries with backoff; pass `--page-size 50` to reduce throughput.
- **search returns nothing after fresh install** — Run `dub-pp-cli sync` once to populate the local store. Search queries the local FTS index, not the live API.
- **links rewrite blasted too many links** — Always use `--dry-run` first. The diff preview shows every link that would change before any mutation.
